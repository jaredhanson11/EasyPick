# Team Walimu: Final Reflection
As we look back on our project, we are proud of the work that we all
accomplished. We think that we made something that actually has use and can
make a difference in people’s lives. We feel that we all worked well together
and could generally be held accountable for what was expected of us. Lara
helped out in a lot of different places and was a huge help in pretty much
every part of the project. Subby spent most of the time on the frontend and
client side taking our MVP to a more final product look. Jared spent most of
the time on the profile page and adding/editing reviews. Famien spent most of
his work with the search page and the recommendations page. Everyone worked
well together. We were fortunate to get a lot of our work done early in the MVP
because the final product didn’t require too much extra work. We definitely made some
small design tweaks, but for the most part our design stays pretty consistent
with our design documents. We think that we planned pretty well. Some
challenges we faced were running into issues with promise libraries and
callbacks. We also were challenged when we had to load a lot of into one server
call, and it slowed our queries. The most difficult challenge is still getting
enough information into the databases for our recommendations to become useful.
We’re looking forward to seeing how good they can get!

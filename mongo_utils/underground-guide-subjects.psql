A variety of techniques are explored and some very different programming styles are introduced, including functional programming, streams, data directed programs, object-oriented programs, and even defining new languages.\n\nThe subject is required for Course VI majors, and is taken by anyone interested in learning about programming in general, rather than learning to use a particular language.  The course provides one important piece of background for UROPs in computer science.\n\nAnyone interested in learning important ideas in programming should take this class.  Do not take the course unless/until you have sufficient commitment.\n\nThe philosophy is suggested above, in the idea that there are concepts in programming that are not specific to any language, but are instead intrinsic to computing.  These are important and useful concepts that will provide guidance no matter what programming language you use.\n\nCollaboration Policy is on the website. (http://sicp.csail.mit.edu/)\n\nThe course evolves constantly.  We keep looking for ways to make it more interesting and more accessible, so that those with little or no prior programming experience still find it a managable challange.\n\nGrade distribution on website.	This subject covered general programming strategies (such as recursion and abstraction), programming models (such as environments and evaluation), and programming styles (such as object-oriented programming).  These concepts were presented through the Scheme language.  There was a good balance between theory and application.	Projects*Problem sets*Staff and resources*Online lectures	Workload and time sink*Archaic scheme*Debugging*Exams	Most students took this class because it is required for Course VI, as well as for various joint programs (i.e. 8A, 2A).  However, many students also found it very interesting and fun.  A fair number of students took it to gain basic understanding and background in programming.	The problem sets were considered by almost everyone as extremely useful for understanding the material.  Some thought they were much too long and time consuming.  Each problem set took approximately 4.3 hours to complete.  The problem sets were web-based and there was a button that could be used to check your work before submission.	The projects were also considered by most students to be very useful for learning the material, although very long.  Some students thought the projects were fun and rewarding.  The Lab Assistants were praised for being very helpful.	There were two exams (25%), six projects (30%), nine problem sets (10%), a final (25%), and participation points (10%).	The text for this class was "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs" 2nd edition by Abelson and Sussman.  Though some students thought the text was very helpful and well written, most students used the lecture slides as their primary source of information, while using the textbook mainly for reference.	Many students felt the exams were straightforward, relevant, and similar to the problem sets.  Others thought the exams were difficult and much too long.  A few students thought the exams should be more difficult, to prevent losing significant points to careless errors.	"[Zamfirescu is] completely awesome."*"Don't say you'll give plenty of time [for the exams] if it's not true."	Don't fall behind and give yourself plenty of time for the projects.  Lab assistants are great resources for help.	http://sicp.csail.mit.edu/Fall-2005/	f	f	core	15	4	\N	\N	\N

Starting with MOS transistors, the course develops of series of building blocks -- logic gates, combinational and sequential circuits, finite-state machines, computers and finally complete systems.  Both hardware and software mechanisms are explored through a series of design examples.\n\n6.004 is required material for any EECS undergraduate who wants to understand (and ultimately design) digital systems.  A good grasp of the material is essential for later courses in digital design, computer architecture and systems.  Before taking 6.004, students should feel comfortable using computers; a rudimentary knowledge of programming language concepts (6.001) and electrical fundamentals (6.002) is assumed.\n\nBesides the lectures, 6.004 offers\n\n(a) an on-line repository of problems -- with solutions -- covering each week's topics.  Students are responsible for this material, but may tackle it on their own schedule.\n\n(b) Recitations, devoted to coverage of problems selected from this repository.\n\n(c) eight mandatory lab assignments, most have open-ended design problems allowing ambitious students to be creative (for additional credit)\n\n(d) Five 50-minute quizzes, held in selected Friday section meetings.\n\nWe published at the start of the term a well-defined formula by which grades are to be distributed -- using absolute performance standards in the above dimensions.  This allows students to accurately track their performance during the term, by completely objective measures.  Details of the grading algorithm are on the course web site, along with handouts, lecture slides, software, and other course materials.\n\nThe lab exercises and projects are intended to give students &amp;amp;quot;hands-on&amp;amp;quot; experience in designing digital systems; each student completes a gate-level design for a RISC processor during the\nsemester.  Access to workstations as well as help from the course staff is provided in the lab but it is possible to complete the assignments using Athena machines or one's home computer.  Students\nare encouraged to get help from others in understanding the material, but the designs and measurements they hand in must be their own work.\n	Students learned how computers work, all the way from transistors up to operating systems.  The material was mostly application, and students particularly enjoyed learning something useful.  Many topics were covered, but not in much depth.	Terman's lectures\nAbsolute grading policy\nBeta processor	JSim\nDebugging labs	Most students took 6.004 because it is required for all Course VI majors.  However, many students also mentioned that they were interested in the subject material, and that the class was highly recommended by others.		Students found the labs extremely useful in learning the material.  The different labs varied in length and difficulty.  There was a consensus that Lab 6: Building the Beta was the longest and most difficult, but many thought it was the most fun as well.	All grades were uncurved, so students were able to tell exactly how many more points were required for an A.  Most students received A's.	There were lecture slides posted online, but not everybody found them useful.  Some students wished the class had a textbook.	Quizzes were fair and straightforward.  They were mainly based on tutorial problems, so students were able to study for them quite effectively.  		\N		f	f	core	15	4	\N	\N	\N

It is also a chance for seniors majoring in CS to flex their engineering muscles.  The typical job for a young CS grad is as part of a large team doing a big project.  The young person doesn't talk to the customer or the users, doesn't have a role in figuring out what the application should do, and doesn't do a whole lot of clean sheet of paper design.  6.171 gives each two- or three-person team a small project that they can do completely by themselves.  The staff of 6.171 is available for coaching and assistance.\r\n\r\nA lot more information about the class and the rationale behind it is available from http://philip.greenspun.com	The class teaches students to design and build web applications.

In addition, the practical experience students gained through the class by working on real world projects was valuable.	Problem sets generally helped students learn the subject matter but were very time consuming.  The assignments were designed to help students with specific aspects of the final project but differences in requirements between the problem sets and the project sometimes negated the benefits of the assignments.	The class was centered around the project which included all aspects of real-world web development.  Students recommended picking a good partner and project.	Grading was considered to be harsh and ambiguous.  Many students commented that they did not understand how grades were assigned.	Readings were available online and were wordy, but useful.	There was one take-home midterm which was relevant and really tested how well students understood the subject content.		\N		f	f	\N	12	12	\N	\N	\N

Being able to guess what a solution looks like will help in later subjects at MIT and in research, for it allows you to think in large chunks, decide quickly whether or not a line of thinking is promising, and invest your effort in the promising lines.\n\nThis subject is organized around several reasoning methods, each illustrated with examples from many areas of mathematics and applied mathematics.  The only background you need is 18.01 so that we can use examples from calculus.  \n\nThe teaching style is informal and, I hope, friendly.  I ask you many questions, and you discuss them with a few neighbors, then we discuss them as a class.  Likewise, your questions are encouraged, whether during lecture or on the (anonymous) feedback sheets handed out at the end of each lecture.  We all learn by asking questions; and often one of the questions turns into an idea for a later lecture.  So don't hold back.\n\nThe next time that I teach the subject, I hope that I will have the notes turned into a textbook.	6.099 taught students how to approach complex problems through approximations and other tricks.

6.803-s2006	2006-12-05 09:20:42	brianwu	6.803	H	The Human Intelligence Enterprise	Spring	2006	Intelligent Analysis of Intelligence	3.5	1.60000000000000009	7	time, interest in AI	29	44	4.5	6.5	What does the subject cover: The goal of the subject is to explore and evaluate progress\r\ntoward the scientific goal of understanding human intelligence from a computational\r\npoint of view. In pursuit of that goal, the subject analyzes seminal work directed at\r\nthe development of a computational understanding of human intelligence, such as work on\r\nchange representation, movement representation, commonsense reasoning, learning, vision,\r\nand language. The subject also reviews the visionary ideas of Turing, Minsky, and other\r\ninfluential thinkers, and examines role of brain scanning, systems neuroscience, and\r\ncognitive psychology.\r\n\r\nWho should take this subject, who should not: The subject is designed for students who\r\nwant the following:\r\n\r\nTo learn about the enterprise of explaining intelligence from a computational point of view. \r\nTo develop a foundation for making personal contributions toward reaching the goal of understanding intelligence. \r\nTo learn how to dig the salient ideas out of a research paper without distraction by minutiae. \r\nTo learn to present complex ideas effectively, as presenting a thesis, delivering a job talk, chatting with a high-ranking official at breakfast, or making a presentation to a potential customer or venture capitalist. \r\nThe subject should be avoided by students who would not attend all the classes because class participation is an essential part of the educational experience. \r\n\r\nWhat is your teaching philosophy:\r\nEvery student's educational experience should include a subject that involves the following: \r\n\r\nReading original papers, evaluating both content and presentation. \r\nLearning via short writing assignments, one per class. \r\nLearning via interactive classroom discussion. \r\nLearning of effective presentation heuristics. \r\nThe philosophy includes the notion that salients matter. Individual students will differ with respect to which technical idea or presentation heuristic will end up as a key, career-enhancing idea or heuristic. \r\n\r\nCollaboration policy:\r\nFree discussion of issues and assignments is encouraged. Noncollaborative reduction of ideas to paper is required, as that is an essential part of the educational experience. \r\n\r\nWhat will be different next time:\r\nExact content will vary, but overall shape will remain the same. \r\n\r\nGrading:\r\nThe grade is determined by writing assignments, one per session, plus classroom contribution, plus project work for the graduate version.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n	The class introduced topics in artificial intelligence through technical papers and class discussions.  These topics covered methods used to analyze the human intelligence.  The papers gave students the opportunity to read important papers in the field while learning about the future of artificial field.  In addition, the class taught communication skills, such as effective presentation skills or summarization skills.	Winston\r\nDonuts\r\nClass Discussions	Length and volume of assignments\r\n9:30AM lecture\r\nMandatory dress code\r\n	Many students cited interest in the artificial intelligence topics and the communication element as their primary reasons for taking the class.  In addition, recommendations from students who had taken the class in previous semesters also motivated students to enroll in the class; many students said the class provided a different experience from other classes they had taken.  Students also took the class to experience a class taught by Professor Winston.  	Students were given writing assignments that related to the reading assignments assigned to the class period.  These papers often required much additional thought and were challenging although students felt that the assignments became easier toward the end of the term.  Most students felt that the assignments helped them learn the material although many also commented that the readings and the papers took a significant amount of time to do. Collaboration and the use of bibles were not allowed for the assignments; however, many students felt that using a bible would not have helped with the assignments.  	\N	The class was split over the grading of the assignment.  Many felt that grading was very harsh and the system of using check plusses and minuses (oftentimes multiple plusses and minuses) was ambiguous and arbitrary.  However, other students commented that the grading was fair.  Some students also mentioned that they would have like more feedback on their papers. 	Many students commented that the readings assignments, which were artificial intelligence technical papers,  were long and were given frequently.  However, the assignments did expose students to topics in the field and included important papers to the field of artificial intelligence.	\N	"He [P. Winston]  has structured the course well, in terms of content and style; every school should have a course like this, and every student should take the course."\r\n\r\n"Learn how to win friends and influence people!

Some liked both the lecture notes and the book, &quot;Signals and Systems&quot; by Oppenheim, while others liked neither.	The quizzes were difficult, but they tested understanding of course concepts.  Students found that reviewing old tests was essential for performing well.

Understanding the homework problems is key to doing well in the course.	This class taught students the fundamentals of electromagnetic waves and applications for E/M like motors, inductors, and resonators.\r\nMost students felt that the material contained a good balance between application and theory but did mention that the content was fairly difficult in that the class covered a large amount of material.\r\nMost students also felt that while the course had a lot of breadth and depth, it was poorly structured.

Working in multidisciplinary teams, students completed a term project to develop a sustainable prototype, which was concluded with a professional presentation, judged by a panel of experts, and a technical presentation to faculty.	This class focused on web development in the use of web-based technologies in industry.

6.034-f2006	2007-02-18 01:18:24	s_hsu	6.034	U	Artificial Intelligence	Fall	2006	Winston's Big Ideas- An ideal introduction to AI	4	0	5.59999999999999964	6.001, Scheme	75	166	3.89999999999999991	5.90000000000000036	The primary focus of the fall version of 6.034 focuses is on applications of Artificial Intelligence research, with particular emphasis on methods and representations for problem solving and learning. The subject also introduces computational models of certain aspects of human intelligence. \r\n\r\n6.034 is required because instructors in higher-level subjects, employers, and graduate schools all have come to expect computer science majors to understand the basic problem solving and learning ideas developed through Artificial Intelligence research. \r\n\r\n6.034 should be taken in any case by students interest in any of the subareas of Artificial Intelligence. Because the material in 6.034 is foundational, 6.034 is a prerequisite for most advanced subjects in AI, including subjects specialized to vision, learning, language, expert systems, medical systems, robotics, and understanding human intelligence from a computational point of view. Many AI-oriented faculty members also consider 6.034 as important background for undertaking UROP projects. \r\n\r\n6.034 should be taken not only by computer science majors, but also by anyone interested in understanding their own intelligence from a computational point of view. \r\n\r\nA key element of the teaching philosophy is that AI's powerful ideas not only enable you to build smarter computer systems, they also enable you to be smarter yourself. \r\n\r\nStudents are encouraged to talk about the assignments and to use as much supporting material as they can find; to equalize opportunity, quizes from the recent past are distributed to everyone. \r\n\r\nThe 6.034 staff will continue to experiment with the material and with the division of function between tutorials, recitations, and lectures. Suggestions for both evolutionary and revolutionary changes are welcome. \r\n	6.034 was an introduction to the field of artificial intelligence.  The class covered search, games, learning algorithms-neural nets, SVMs, nearest neighbor, ID trees-expert systems; genetic algorithms. Other topics included the theory of human intelligence and algorithms for phonology.  Students felt the class matched their expectations and felt there was a good balance between application and theory.	Winston's Lectures\r\nProblem Sets\r\nGrading Policy\r\nMega-recitation\r\nInteresting material	Problem Sets\r\nDebugging Scheme\r\nUnorganized Staff	Students took 6.034 because it was a VI-3 header and because of their interest in AI.  Many students also wanted to take a class with Professor  Winston.  Students even felt that non-Course VI majors should take the class and recommended going to lecture.	Student opinion on how useful the five problem sets were to the class was split; some thought the problem sets were extremely useful and provided a good balance between application and theory. Others believed that most of the problems were mundane, dull, and not useful and tested your ability to code in Scheme more than your understanding of the concepts. Some found collaboration helpful, and a few students would prefer the problem sets to have a paper-written component as well (instead of coding only). Finally, some students found that problem sets had nothing to do with the quizzes.		The max grade method (take the maximum score between a quiz and its corresponding section on the final exam) was highly appreciated.  Students liked getting two chances to prove that they knew the material.  Overall, most of the people found the grading policy fair or even great.  The grading policy, however, was not clear to students until the end of the semester.  In addition, quizzes were graded on a flattened weighting system: beyond the minimum threshold for a certain letter grade, any additional correct answers are worthless if they do not bump you up to the next letter grade.	Although the lecture notes were useful, students felt that the readings did not include all of the lecture topics.	The four exams did a good job of judging how well students understood the material.  Students recommended attending recitation and preparing by doing old quizzes but felt that problem sets and lectures did not help prepare them for the quizzes.	"Excellent. AI is as interesting as I thought it would be."\r\n\r\n"Haha, good luck trying to live up to Winston. He's so good :)"\r\n\r\n"I seriously doubt anyone else (other than Winston) can do it better."\r\n\r\n"I have learned more than I ever thought I would learn in this class. Its theories are applicable not only to AI, but to real life as well. The lectures and recitations are exciting and explore philosophy and science, as well as engineering. This class is incredible!"\r\n\r\n	The suggestions that were proposed are more or less the following: Spend a lot more time on neural nets!! (And improve the teaching of neural nets.) Have the enphasis on AI, not Scheme. In terms of scheduling, add more recitation sections so people aren't left without one. Bring in some more exciting ideas/material every now and then to inspire students about AI as a whole. &quot;Have lectures where you actually teach something instead of being very high level or treating something as trivial then going around and distributing quizzes who no one could have passed if they have just went to lectures,&quot; as a student said. Both tutorial and recitation should change to focus on problems as they appear on the quizzes.\nHave up-to-date, concise, and relevant course material that a student can use to study for the exams and do the problem sets without having to decide what's relevant or not. Comments about TAs were also heard- the suggestion being that the staff should have TAs that are available to help.\n	http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.034/ 	t	f	AIA	12	4	\N	\N	\N

We try to  teach through interesting and fun examples.  All Area 2 students should take this course, unless they get the material through more advanced subjects.  The course is valuable for almost every more advanced course in computer science.  Students who've taken 6.041 may find the last third of the course largely review.  	This class was an introduction to discrete mathematics, with a few connections to the field of computer science.  The first part of the class taught proofs, followed by a variety of topics including graphs, counting, and probability.  Because of the breadth of material, little depth went into each particular topic.	Tom Leighton\r\nGames in lectures\r\nIce cream	Mandatory recitations\nLong problem sets	Students took this class because it was a requirement for Course VI, and also a prerequisite for other Course VI classes.	Students felt that the problems sets were doable and helped reinforce material taught in lecture.  Most students found collaborating with other students useful, and few used course bibles.  Problem sets contained a few challenging problems, and they were average to long in length.	\N	Most students commented that the grading was fair.  Students liked that they were given the formula for computing grades up front, and that the class average was normalized to 75, with an 88 being an A.  Students liked that they could drop 10% of their lowest grade, but didn't like that recitations were mandatory and counted as 20% of the grade.	No textbook was used for the class, but the class notes were exceptional.  The notes were a good representation of what happened in lecture, and they explained the concepts well.  The only bad comments were that they were posted late.	There were two exams during the term in addition to the final.  The exams were comparable to the problem sets in difficulty, although the second quiz slightly more difficult.  Students also felt they accurately measured material in the class, and psets and recitations were good preparation for them.	"It's like a grab bag of mathematics."\r\n\r\n"Class notes were stellar (no pun intended)"	Students felt that recitations shouldn't be mandatory, or if they are, they should either count for less or be more instructive instead of purely problem solving.  A few students also thought more time should be spent on theory and less on proofs.	http://theory.csail.mit.edu/classes/6.042/fall06/	f	f	math	12	0	\N	\N	\N

There were no problem sets.	Before the final project, students completed five lab assignments.  The earlier labs were generally easy and helped students learn the concepts, which prepared students for the final project.  The &quot;legendary&quot; final project was generally well liked if a bit time consuming.  Some students had trouble with the hardware or software, but they felt that working through these problems was instructive.	The final grades were weighted heavily toward the final project (40%).  Some people felt that the final project evaluations were a bit arbitrary.  They also disliked the grading of the one written paper that satisfied the CI-M requirement.  Most students, however, thought that grading in the class was done fairly.	The lecture notes were somewhat helpful, but they were not necessary.  Students did not use the recommended textbook, &quot;Contemporary Logic Design&quot; by Katz.	The one quiz was described as fair and not particularly difficult.  Students felt that it differed from practice exams but contained no surprises.	"You really shouldn't leave MIT without taking this class."	Students suggested updating software and fixing some broken libraries.  Compiler bugs were frustrating.  Students also wished that TA's were available in lab more.

The subject was a mixture of very classical topics such as the lambda calculus and type systems but also included emerging programming techniques based on guarded atomic actions. Dataflow was also presented as a classic parallel execution model and its exploitation from functional languages. The subject offers a way to satisfy the Programming Language TQE requirement for doctoral students.  	The first half of the course was focused on functional programming, lambda calculus, and type systems. The second half covered different models of parallelism. There was very little content on compilers. Most of the material focused around the lecturer's research experiences.

There were some issues with them in terms of errors or timing problems (one was scheduled to be due on a test day), and general disorganization. Some felt a disconnect between the problem sets and the course material.	The final project replaced the final exam. The time taken to complete the project was approximately equivalent to that of a problem set which did not leave much time to do complicated or interesting/in-depth projects.	Grades were composed of problem sets (25%), two quizzes (50%), and the final project (25%).	The textbook (&quot;Implicit Parallel Programming in pH&quot; by Nikhil and Arvind) was decent and gave greater depth about topics presented in class.	The quizzes were straightforward and did not go into depth of the material. Most students thought they were fair.

Because databases are used in so many areas -- from the Internet to business processing to a variety of scientific domains -- this course should be of interest to any systems-oriented computer science student.  \n\n6.830 satisfies the doctoral qualifier for Course VI PhD students in systems. It expands on topics from 6.033 related to transaction processing and recovery, and also discusses database system architecture, query processing and optimization, and a range of other topics. Some coding experience, familiarity with transactions and algorithms are pre-requisites for the course. \n\n2006 was the second year we offered the course. Grades were assigned based on three problem sets, three Java-based lab assignments designing a basic database system (due over the first half of the semester), a class project, and two exams.	6.830 covered the internal components of database systems and taught database theory and design.  Topics included efficiency in data storage, deadlocks, queries, and recovery.  	Sam Madden\r\nMaking a working database\r\nDiscussions	Time commitment\r\nWork load	Students took this class to learn more about databases and to satisfy the TQE requirement.	Problem sets were tedious and too long.  Some students commented that they were glad that the problem sets stopped to make time for projects.  Labs were more useful for learning.	The labs were appreciated because they were instructive and reasonable in difficulty.  Sometimes they took too long to debug, but the hands-on component of the class was very useful.	Grades consisted of problem sets and labs (25%), two exams (15%), final project (30%), and participation (15%).	Class notes were generally sufficient for understanding.  Students felt that the textbook (&quot;Database Management Systems&quot; by Ramakrishnan and Gehrke) was unnecessary because all of the important papers could be found online.	The exams were very fair and perhaps a bit easy.  Students felt that attending lecture and reading assigned papers was sufficient for high exam performance.	"It's a paper-reading and discussion class; that's the best kind."	A broader focus would be appreciated.  Some students felt that more preparation before discussion would be helpful.

Professor Chun\r\nGuest lecturers	Assignments	Students took this class to learn some basic skills in business and management.  Many hoped the class would help them in future careers. 	Students said problem sets were fairly easy, though some parts were confusing or time consuming. Collaboration was helpful but sometimes difficult due to students being from different backgrounds.		Problems sets were not graded promptly and point deductions were not explained.	Students complained the course notes were too expensive and/or a waste of money and wished they were online. Old editions did not have all the necessary materials.	Most students thought the exam was fair although a few found it tricky.		-- keep the syllabus, but revamp the teaching\n-- make better defined learning goals\n-- peer evaluations sheets for group project to prevent slackers and/or supplement business plan with data as to who made which contributions\n-- give feedback on the business plan	http://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/2/fa06/2.96/index.html	f	f	none	12	0	\N	\N	\N

Relative to 6.011, a primary focus is to distinguish between conceptual tools and those that can be used in actual implementation; thus attention is paid to finite-order filters and estimates made from finite data sets.  This course is not required, but it is essential for students planning to do signal processing in a practical setting, or advanced graduate work and research in signal processing.  A solid background in the topics covered in 6.011 and a maturity consistent with this being a graduate subject are essential.  Students are encouraged to work in groups but each student is expected to understand the assignments in depth.  Bibles can be helpful if used properly, and hazardous if not.  In the future, the subject will continue to shorten the early review of 6.011 material (expecting students to review this more on their own) and to incorporate more advanced topics.	The class covered the theory behind discrete signal processing and focused on analyzing discret-time systems.  Some students felt that the class was too heavy on the theory. Generally, students felt that the content of the class was good and that it met their expectations.	Subject matter\r\nGreat TAs\r\nAccessiblity of staff	Hard exams\r\nLarge amounts of math in lecture\r\nDry lectures\r\n	Students who took this class were interested in signal processing and related fields.	Problem sets were long and graded strictly. Students felt that they were the best way to study for the class.	The two design projects were fair, and extremely useful provided that the proper amount of time was put into the projects.	Generally, students felt that the grading was fair.  Some complained that the grading was too harsh.	Most students felt that the textbook (&quot;Discrete Time Signal-Processing&quot; by Oppenheim, Buck, and Schafer) was excellent.  Many also felt that the  notes were not sufficient to understand the course material.	While a few students felt that the exams were fair, many also felt that the final and mideterm were too long and too hard in comparison to the problem sets in the class.	"Bose might hire me now."	Students suggested that there be less math in lectures, that lectures be more enthusiastic, and that a mathematics refresher at the beginning of the course would be useful.	http://web.mit.edu/6.341/Fall06/www/	f	f	CCS	12	0	\N	\N	\N

Students work in small teams to tackle advanced projects combining sensing (leading to perception), computation (leading to high-level palnning and low-level motion control), and actuation (leading to purposeful motion in the real environment).  This term the subject is focused on the DARPA Urban Challenge, the goal of which is to develop a passenger vehicle capable of safe, autonomous drivin in urban environments.  Students work with DGC team members to define, specify, design and implement capability modules in support of the DGC effort.  Prototyping is performed on a small laboratory robot, the &quot;Splinter,&quot; with a control system configured to emulate a vehicle's control DOFs (gear, steering, gas, brake).  Graduate students enroll in 6.897, the companion subject, and work in teams with undergraduates.	The class was a continuation of 6.141.  Topics covered were centered around current research areas and included path planning, vision, and obstacle detection.  Students completed a final project during the second half of the semester, which some felt was too open-ended.  A few students also commented that they thought the class would be working on the Darpa Grand Challenge but actually did not get the chance to participate in the contest.  	Final Project	Not working on the Darpa Grand Challenge	Students took the class because they were interested in building large-scale robots within a team.	There were no problem sets.	Students stressed choosing an interesting topic as a final project, although some students felt that the large-scale projects they wanted to do were limited by the small team sizes.  The project was a good learning experience and very autonomous.	Some students were felt that the grading scheme was not clear while others felt that grades were assigned fairly.

The class was aimed at implementing a compiler for the language Decaf. The project was very open-ended and students liked being able to design their own compiler.	Grading were based on the project (70%) and three quizzes (30%). The project grade was based on how many test cases the compiler passed.	There was no required textbook. Some students found lecture notes to be helpful.	The quizzes tested mainly material presented in lecture. They were long and covered many topics but were unrelated to the final project.

The course begins with finite-difference and finite-volume methods, then covers finite-element methods, and ends with integral equation methods.  The course is intended for first year graduate students or advanced undergraduates who are interested in numerical techniques and have a basic background in partial differential equations and linear algebra.  Students learn the material by using MATLAB to investigate and design numerical algorithms, and there are no exams.	The class content focused around four different numerical methods for solving partial differential equations (PDEs).  The concepts were applicable to engineering systems, and students felt that the class was very well-designed.

Grading on problem sets was somewhat harsh and vague. There was substantial variation in the difficulty of problem sets.	Labs were long, and involved much tweaking and debugging. While tedious, students found the process of doing the labs beneficial because of the relevance to real-life circuit design. Lab 2 was particularly long, and starting early was highly recommended.	Students were not familiar with how they were being graded, and thought that different TAs may be using different grading criteria. Other than that, grading was fair but some noted that it was arbitrary.	Dr. Lundberg's notes were very effective but could have included more detail.	The exams were straightforward for the most part, and were what the students expected. Most students commented that the exams were fair and representative of the material taught in class.

It was split into three main units: symbolic planning, robot motion planning, and probabilistic planning. Students felt it was a good combination of theory and practice; algorithms were presented in class, then implemented and explored in hands-on problem sets. 	Professor Lozano-Perez\r\nExciting material	None	Not enough comments for summary.	Problem sets involved implementing algorithms from class and writing a report explaining the methods and results. Although students found them time-consuming and sometimes tricky to get right, they really helped students understand the material and were only assigned every few weeks. Some students found the instructions to be too vague on occasion.   	There were no labs in this class.	Students were not certain how grading would turn out, but felt confident that it would be fair.	Reference material was drawn from a large variety of sources, available online, which students found useful. Although there were some recommended textbooks, most students did not use them. 	The quizzes were open-note and fairly assessed students' understanding of the algorithms presented in class. 		\N		f	f	TCS	12	\N	\N	\N	\N
6.831-f2006	2007-03-18 02:09:13	s_hsu	6.831	H	User Interface Design and Implementation 	Fall	2006	User interfaces revealed.	2.79999999999999982	6.29999999999999982	5.5	6.170 (JAVA)	27	66	4.29999999999999982	6	6.831 covers the principles of user interface development, focusing on three key areas:\r\n\r\n* Design. How to design good user interfaces, starting with human capabilities (including the human information processor model, perception, motor skills, color, and attention) and using those capabilities to drive design techniques: task analysis, user-centered design, iterative design, usability guidelines, and graphic design principles.\r\n\r\n* Implementation.  Techniques for building user interfaces, including low-fidelity prototypes, Wizard of Oz, and other prototyping tools; input models, output models, model-view-controller, layout, constraints, declarative user interfaces, and toolkits.\r\n\r\n* Evaluation. Techniques for evaluating and measuring interface usability, including heuristic evaluation, predictive evaluation, and user testing.\r\n\r\n6.831 is an elective course, not required.  Students should take it if they want to learn more about software engineering for user interfaces than 6.170 teaches.  This class helps prepare for research that involves user interfaces, including running user studies to evaluate them.  Some students' class projects are related to their graduate research, but this isn't necessary.\r\n\r\nNecessary prerequisites are knowledge of Java and prior exposure to some graphical user interface programming.  6.170 provides both of these prerequisites, but students can get them other ways.  6.831 is not merely a design class; we actually build software, so programming skills are required.\r\n\r\nThe most important take-home concept from 6.831 is the importance of iterative design.  If the basic message of a course like 6.170 might be described as &quot;think first, code second&quot;, then 6.831 refines that message to &quot;think, code, evaluate, and then think again.&quot;  Another important message of 6.831 is that you are not the user -- if you design only for yourself, and what you think is appropriate, you won't produce usable software.\r\n\r\nCollaboration is encouraged -- students may discuss the assignments with each other, but all written and programming work on individual problem sets must be done by individuals.  Using bibles of past problem set solutions is not allowed.\r\n\r\n	6.831 taught students how to create, iterate, and evaluate user interfaces.  The class was relevant to real world problems and provided the theory necessary to design good user interfaces.\r\n	UI Hall of Fame/Shame\r\nRob Miller\r\nLectures	Work load\r\nHomework and project deliverables due in the same week	Many students took 6.831 because it was recommended to them by their peers.  Others took it because of its status as a Grad-H class and CS elective.  And still others had an authentic interest in UI programming.	Problem sets in 6.831 were relatively easy, but time consuming.  They were moderately to very useful for learning the material.\r\n\r\n	6.831 had a final design project in which groups of students select and implement a project.  Most students considered designing of the final project useful in reinforcing class material.  However, some students considered actually implementing their design to be not very useful.  The design project took a lot of time and required a lot of work.	Most students felt the grading policies of 6.831 were fair.  However, several students claimed that grading was harsh and sometimes seemed arbitrary on problem sets.\r\n	6.831 did not have a textbook.  However, the lecture notes were excellent and quite thorough.\r\n\r\n	Quizzes in 6.831 required extensive amounts of memorization but were considered fair by students.  The quizzes were described as straightforward, and similar to previous terms' quizzes.  Students noted that the class notes were very useful in preparing for quizzes.\r\n	"Great class for learning more about user interface design and implementation."\r\n\r\n"Miller's teaching style is excellent, and the labs are fun."	  There was no uniform suggestion for the class.  Some of the more constructive criticism were requests to space out assignments better and bring in guest lecturers from the gaming industry.	http://groups.csail.mit.edu/uid/6.831/ 	f	f	\N	12	6	\N	\N	\N

I try to focus on the most interesting aspects of the subject and I'd hope students to appreciate that computation has a beautiful and relevant theoretical aspect.  Students are permitted (though not encouraged) to collaborate on homework.  Bibles aren't permitted.	This course is a thorough introduction to the theory of computation and complexity theory.  The first half of the class focused on whether a problem can in principle be solved algorithmically. Topics included regular expressions, context-free grammars, Turing-recognizability and T-decidable languages.  The second class discussed how difficult it was to solve problems, given that they were solvable algorithmically and included topics such as complexity classes.	The textbook\r\nThe material\r\nSipser\r\nLectures	Problem Sets	Everyone pointed to the interesting subject material as well as great teaching as motivation for taking this class.	The problem sets were good at solidifying the material.  Students found collaboration very helpful.			Most students thought that the textbook written by Sipser was excellent.  The text paralleled lectures and gave more detail on topics introduced in class.	Most students thought that the exams were challenging but fair, and resembled the level of difficulty of problem sets.	"Sipser is a model. One thing we were all wondering though: how did he get that black eye?"\r\n\r\n"Math makes you feel dumb, even if you're not."	One student mentioned he would have preferred weekly problem sets w/half the length instead of bi-weekly psets that were twice the length.		f	f	math	12	0	\N	\N	\N

Problem sets were useful in applying the theory, and the problems varied from useful to a little contrived, with some of them being tedious.  The difficulty appeared to vary based on programming background.  Most students did not collaborate or use a bible.	\N		The lecture notes were useful, but the examples were not very helpful.  Students felt that using the textbook (Manning &amp;amp; Schutze) would provide better examples, although they understand that it does not cover recent research.	There was one midterm in the class, which students felt was fair, balanced, and similar to the problem sets.  Both the midterm and the final drew out understanding of the material well.		A common suggestion was to improve class notes so they were consistent and non-repetitive, and to rethink the topics to stick closer to the textbook.  Collins should be careful as to not rush through material, and better connections between concepts would have helped.		f	f	none	12	0	\N	\N	\N

A large range of interesting and useful topics in data structures and types of computational models are covered. Although the work is difficult, the class is rewarding and provides a strong background for further work with algorithms.	Professor Karger\r\nCool material	Weekly problem sets\r\nStudent grading	\N	Problem sets were due weekly and were worth 70% of the final grade. Students agreed that they were interesting and useful for learning, but extremely time-consuming. Many students found collaboration indispensable.	There was one straightforward final project, in which students chose one topic and wrote a 10-page paper on their work. The project could be a summary of current papers on the topic, a new approach to an existing algorithmic problem, or an implementation of an algorithm covered in class.	Many students disliked the peer grading system for problem sets, because they felt it was inconsistent and did not provide meaningful feedback. Ultimately, though, the majority expected the final grade distribution to be fair.	There was no textbook, but there were basic class notes online. Although the notes were not as detailed as lecture, they were often useful for review. In addition, some students thought that CLRS, the textbook for 6.046, was a useful reference for parts of the class.	There were no quizzes or exams in this class.

This is one of two new courses, replacing previous core and advanced graduate courses 6.432 and 6.433, and this is the first semester in which this new course has been taught (it will now become a regular fall semester graduate course).  This course covers, in considerable depth and rigor, the fundamentals of estimation, including: (1) Linear estimation and the importance of vector space and geometric concepts such as orthogonality and whitening; (2) The use of linear estimation and vector space concepts for Karhunen-Loeve representations, periodogram analysis, Wiener filtering, Kalman filtering, smoothing algorithms, and the Levinson recursions; (3) The use of system theoretic and linear algebraic methods for deeper analysis of Kalman filters and Riccati equations; (4) Recursive estimation, smoothing, and optimization for Markov processes, including particle filtering and the Viterbi algorithm; and (5) An introduction to graphical models/Markov random fields and the generalization of results seen previously to message-passing algorithms on graphs.  These topics are essential for any graduate student seeking to work in the areas of statistical signal processing, estimation, and machine learning.  The course assumes a background and graduate-level maturity of understanding of signals and systems, probability, and linear algebra.  I teach this course assuming a class of students who are in the process of becoming professionals in the field and are motivated because of their own professional interests to master the material.  This is not a course to be taken by undergraduates or students taking undergraduate-like course loads.  Collaboration is something that I would encourage, as this is not easy material to master, and students will definitely benefit from wrestling with the concepts together with others.  However, using &amp;amp;quot;bibles&amp;amp;quot; (which don't yet exist for this new course) is not a good idea, as thinking about the problems on problem sets is far more important than copying the solutions.  As this is the first time the course has been taught, there will certainly be some changes over the next few years-in one part to provide more cohesive sets of notes (this semester we used notes from the old 6.432 and 6.433 which were imperfectly matched to the course, together with some new supplementary notes intended to fill in the gaps and new material not covered in either of the old courses).  In addition, there will undoubtedly be some changes in content, with some material likely to be dropped from the course so that we can focus more time on some topics that are of far greater importance currently.	This class covered a variety of different kinds of mathematical modeling/estimation techniques and stochastic process.  The topics were applicable to many fields and included linear estimation, filtering, Markov processes, and many others.  Some students liked the diversity in topics while others would have preferred a narrower scope and felt that the class tried to cover too much.	Interesting, relevant material\r\nProfessor Willskey\r\nProfessor Freeman\r\nLectures	Too many topics\r\nFast-paced lectures\r\nLong exams	Students took this class because the material was relevant to their work, and they wanted to learn more about estimation theory.  Some students recommended planning enough time to work though each problem set, but most considered it a useful class.  The class satisfied the TQE requirement for graduate students.	The problem sets were useful and necessary for understanding the material.  Some students thought the algebra could get somewhat tedious.  They were challenging, and collaboration could be helpful, but, with enough time, were doable.		Grades consisted of a midterm (30%), final (50%), and problem sets (20%).	The class notes were well written and explained things clearly but many students found them overwhelming because there were so many readings.	Most students found the exam to be long and wanted extra time.  Many people felt that the actual problems were fair, but wanted less of them on the exam.		Most recommendations centered around the fact that many students thought this class covered too much.  Some people suggested cutting out a few topics, or splitting the class into two classes.  Many people wished that they could go through some topics more slowly.		f	f	CCS	12	0	\N	\N	\N

The discussions spanned the historical, cognitive,\r\nacademic, sociological, political, and economic aspects of education.\r\nThere were no writing assignments, problem sets, projects,\r\npresentations, or exams.\r\n\r\nTopics included: understanding and teaching scientific thought\r\nprocesses, how Western and Eastern cultures influence ways of\r\nthinking, analysis of the teaching of elementary mathematics in China\r\nand the U.S., how privileged parents undermine school reform, how\r\nchess grandmasters and concert pianists acquire their expertise,\r\nevaluating the effectiveness of the lecture system, design-oriented\r\nanalysis and low-entropy expressions, the economics and history of\r\ntextbook publishing, the history of public education, and experiments\r\nin changing mathematics teaching.\r\n\r\nEvery participant had some teaching experience and an interest in\r\neducation, prerequisites for productive and enjoyable discussions.\r\nEveryone helped decide what readings were assigned and what aspects of\r\nthose readings were discussed.  The weekly meetings lasted for an\r\nhour, but so much came out of the meetings that we wished they were a\r\nlittle longer.\r\n\r\n6.969 was run as a one-time experiment this term, and will be offered\r\nagain in 2007-2008 if there is interest.  Our goal was to bring\r\ntogether students with an interest in education and give them an\r\nopportunity to pursue that interest and share their experiences.  We,\r\nthe instructors, hope that what the participants got out of the\r\nseminar met or exceeded their expectations; we learned a lot from the\r\nconversations.\r\n\r\nIf we were to run the seminar again, we'd use either most of the same\r\nreadings (with different students), or different readings that could\r\naccommodate newcomers and those who took 6.969 this term.

It surveys the various uses of computing in clinical medicine and in bioinformatics research, with illustrations from contemporary research and development efforts. The class is required for students in the HST Bio-Medical Informatics master's program, and serves as an Engineering Concentration for Couse 6 undergraduates and M.Eng. students. We use concepts from artificial intelligence (6.034), basic notions from distributed systems and cryptography, and rely on some knowledge of databases and web-based systems design and implementation.  Students can learn these areas as we need them, but with extra work.  Students are encouraged to collaborate on a class project, though individual homework assignments are to be done individually. We are unaware of bibles for the course, but notes from previous years are often posted. We are still seeking to develop a more integrated presentation of the modeling and analytical methods that apply to both clinical and genetic/genomic data, and plan to develop this in future years.	The class was an introductory course that discussed the relationship between bioinformatics and clinical informatics and the computer science.  The topics presented were up to date and provided a good overview of the field.  In addition, students felt the guest lecturers contributed greatly to the class as they had practical experience and were very knowledgeable.	Guest Lecturers\r\nBroad Coverage	Too Technical/Detailed	Many students enrolled in the class to fulfill graduation requirements.	Some students were confused when completing problem sets as they felt that the questions asked were either not covered in lecture or that the questions were difficult to understand.  Students found collaboration helpful and suggested that going over answers in class might have helped.	The final project was open-ended but was useful toward learning the material.  Some programming experience or knowledge of genetics was helpful to complete the project.		Some students felt the textbook, &quot;Medical Informatics: Computer Applications in Health Care and Biomedicine&quot; by Shortliffe, was useful while other students did not use the text.

Transported charge is the basis of electrical properties of neurons. The second half of the subject focuses on models of neural behavior.\n\nThe class is intended to be introductory with regard to biology but builds on previous exposure to engineering models. Emphasis is on understanding the physical principles underlying mathematical models of cells and on applying the models to understand cellular behaviors.	This class focused on the theory of cellular transport and physiology from an engineering point of view.  Topics combined principles in electrical engineering and biology and included developing mathematical models for cellular systems.	Prof. Freeman\r\nLectures	Microfluidics lab	6.021 was a Course VI EE header and also was a requirement for BME minors.  Many students also cited interest in biology as a reason for taking the class.	Nearly all students found the problem sets useful and representative of the material presented in class.  The assignments were long and students who collaborated found working with other students helpful.  	Students completed two lab projects for 6.021.  The microfluidics lab was frustrating due to malfunctioning lab equipment and could have been better designed to reflect the class material.  The Hodgkin-Huxley lab was generally liked by students as it was more reasonable in length and helped students understand the material.		The textbook, &amp;quot;Cellular Biophysics&amp;quot; by Weiss, was a decent reference source but did not correlate well with the class.  Students also found the lecture notes to be helpful.	The two exams in the class were fair and included problems a bit harder than those on the problem sets.  However, many quiz problems resembled homework problems.

Since students  have varying degrees \r\nof past experiences in these areas, and because  we present and build upon basic \r\nmaterial, we recognize that some  students may find parts of the course frustrating, and, \r\non occasion,  seemingly patronizing. However, no matter the experience level, there  is \r\nalways room to improve. This is an unusual class in that the  course's objective is to \r\nprovide guidance and feedback as students  complete the various assignments (rather than \r\nto teach a specific  body of technical knowledge). Students get out of the class what \r\nthey  put into these assignmentes, and we invite them to 1) take the  initiative to \r\ncreate custom value for themselves, 2) use the  materials, exercises and assignments to \r\nexperiment, 3) improve their  abilities in these important skills, and 4) develop their \r\nown  personal style. We hope that students take the time to use 6.UAT as  an opportunity \r\nto experiment and hone their skills -- an activity  better done now, in a supportive \r\nenvironment with little consequence,  as opposed to later, when mistakes can be \r\nprofessionally costly. The  course is continually evolving, and we welcome input and \r\nsuggestions  for improvement. Finally, although not required, it is helpful if  students \r\nhave a thesis project or potential project topic in mind when starting the class.	This class taught communication skills for the business world. Students gave frequent presentations to practice communication skills.  The lectures covered a multitude of topics (presentations, negotiation, ethics, entrepreneurship) and were often given by guest lecturers. Attendance to lectures and recitations was mandatory.\r\nThe key thing that students left the class with was the ability to give pre-prepared presentations.

The class was divided about the fairness of the grading. Many thought the grading was fair, but some thought it was too harsh or subjective, depending on the instructor doing the grading.  All assignments were graded on a scale of 0 to 4.		There were no exams.

We study several kinds of components, including transistors and opamps, and we describe how with these components one can build all kinds of circuits for logic, analog and power applications. We introduce important abstractions, such as the frequency domain and the impedance technique. \r\n\r\nThis subject is mandatory for all EECS students and is highly recommended to all engineers. \r\n\r\nThe prerequisites for this subject (8.02 and 18.03 or 18.06) are genuine and strictly inforced. \r\n\r\nMy teaching philosophy is to emphasize fundamental understanding rather than circuic solving drudgery. I also emphasize hands-on learning through the lab projects and the online laboratory assignments. \r\n\r\nI encourage students to work together. Many of them learn better this way. All the work that they turn in must have been personally made by them. bibles are also encouraged. \r\n\r\nNext time I hope to bring in more web resources such as online simulators. \r\n\r\n	6.002 was an introduction to electronic circuits and covered circuit components and techniques for building and analyzing circuits. Most students liked the content and the balance between application and theory, though some felt there was too much material. A few were disappointed that BJTs weren't covered and many disliked the use of Powerpoint slides during lecture.  Relevant in-class demonstrations were a strong point.	Labs (especially the audio player lab)\nMaterial\nDemos\nRecitation Instructors	Long problem sets\nLabs\nBroken lab equipment\nLectures	Most students took the class because it is required for Course VI, but many also were interested or wanted exposure to the material. They recommended the class to anyone interested in electronics, but make sure to have enough time to commit to it and to start early on labs and problem sets. 	The problem sets were long and difficult, and sometimes were due the same week as a lab. They were useful for learning the material and preparing for exams, but required tedious and time-consuming algebra. Collaboration and bible use were common, and helped students save time and understand the material. 	The four labs were well-designed and sometimes fun, but could also be frustrating and time-consuming. Many students wasted time due to broken lab equipment, and those who lacked prior electronics experience were never taught to use the equipment. The TAs and LAs were not available often enough and were not very helpful. The first three labs involved following instructions instead of design. Students enjoyed the last lab, in which they designed and built an audio playback circuit.	Most thought the grading policy was fair overall, but some were not sure what the policy was or thought it was not clear enough. A few thought the first quiz should have been graded on a curve or worth less than the second quiz. 	The class notes were helpful and concise but not detailed enough. The textbook, &amp;quot;Foundations of Analog and Digital Electronic Circuits&amp;quot; by Agarwal and Lang, was dense and covered much more material than the lectures; some students therefore had a hard time finding what they were looking for. Opinion was divided on whether the textbook or class notes were more useful. Most students used either the textbook or the notes and felt that the other was not necessary. 	There were two quizzes. The first was too difficult, but the second was much easier. The quizzes were harder than the problem sets and required a thorough understanding of the material. Some students thought the quizzes required knowing tricks to solve the problems. Quiz questions sometimes contained multiple parts, with later parts depending on the previous ones. Practice quizzes and problem sets were helpful for studying. 	"I learned about modeling circuits and drawing them out on pieces of paper. I don't feel like I really learned anything at all about building them."\r\n\r\n"The psets were just painful and the oscilloscopes were worse."\r\n	Students suggested using the blackboard rather than Powerpoint in lecture, since Powerpoint slides caused the material to go by too fast. They also would have liked more TAs and LAs in lab and working lab equipment, or at least having broken lab equipment labeled. An overview of how to use lab equipment would have helped - many students had never used oscilloscopes before. A few thought too much time was spent on differential equations, since 18.03 is a prerequisite. Other suggestions included more interesting labs, shorter problem sets, fixed office hours, more depth and examples in the lecture notes, and not having problem sets and labs in the same week. 	http://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/6/fa06/6.002/index.html	f	f	core	15	4	\N	\N	\N

Four classes of problems are discusses: discounted bounded cost problem, stochastic shortest path, unbounded cost problem, and the average cost problem. Both complete and incomplete information structures are analyzed. Solutions methods using value iteration, policy iteration, linear programming, simulation, and approximation are introduced. This course should be taken by students interested in control systems, dynamic optimization, and general decision systems. The initial part of the course covers the theory behind DP with simple examples ilustrating the concepts. The latter part of the course addresses the practical applications of DP through approximation methods. Students are required to work on a project that will enforce the use of DP. Students can discuss pset solutions with each other. Projects are performed in groups. I will spend more time on approximation methods.	This class focused on both the theory and applications of using dynamic programming as a decision-making tool.  Topics covered in the class spanned a variety of subjects and included optimal decision making, control methods, infinite horizon problems as well as many other topics.

Many also cited interest in dynamic programming as a reason for taking the class.	The problem sets were useful and helped students understand the material but could be long and tedious.  The later assignments were not as difficult as the problem sets early in the semester.	This class had a final project that took students, in teams of 2-3 people, about two weeks to complete.  Some students liked the final project, but others felt that they would have liked more guidance choosing topics and more well-defined goals.		The required text, &quot;Dynamic Progamming and Optimal Control, Vol. 1&quot; by Bertsekas and the recommended text, &quot;Dynamic Programming and Optimal Control, Vol. 2&quot; were both excellent sources of information.	There was one 24- hour take-home final, which most students thought was reasonable but quite difficult.		Shorter problem sets would help smooth the workload out over the semester, and prevent problem sets from getting too far ahead.\n\nAlso, some students would have preferred a narrower focus with more depth. 	http://web.mit.edu/6.231/www/6231.html 	f	f	CCS	12	0	\N	\N	\N

The midterm exam was take-home and it included several numerical problems that required fairly long time to solve.		More sample problems would be very helpful in solidifying the material.

Students learned to apply engineering principles to situations involving these devices, while learning the theoretical principles behind them. Students designed their own experiments, and freshmen learned lab skills, organization, and time-management. The class is small, leading to a &quot;tight-knit and hands-on&quot; experience.	Small class.\nCool projects.\nGetting research experience.\nGetting to know faculty.	Time commitment (more like 12 insted of 9 units).\n	Most students took this class because they were curious about biology-related majors. They wanted lab experience and were interested in building things from the ground up.	Students found the assignments useful and open-ended. This open-endedness sometimes led to ambiguity, causing students to spend much more time than necessary.	All students agreed that the labs were &amp;quot;great&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;amazing&amp;quot;. They learned a lot about microfludics and general lab techniques, and came away with a sense of accomplishment at the end. The open-endedness of the lab assignments was  a big change for the freshmen, who were used to high-school-style rigid procedures.	Students did not know the grading policy until late in the term. Overall, they found it fair.	There was no textbook. Students found the class notes informative and useful.	There were no quizzes or exams, just labs, papers and a final project and presentation.	"SO MUCH BETTER THAN ANOTHER LECTURE CLASS. I looked forward to this class after a long day sitting in 10-250."	Leave more time for the final project, and keep the environment informal and the emphasis on practical learning.		f	f	none	9	0	\N	\N	\N

This class is intended for graduate students without a background in quantum physics but whose math skills cover linear algebra as used signals and systems, and Fourier Transforms. Students are encouraged to collaborate on the homework assignments.  \r\n\r\nStudents who complete the class should know how to solve and understand Schodinger's Equation for simple systems, model the dynamics of a two-level quantum system, and understand the nature of transitions and the origins of statistical probability functions for fermions and bosons. Students will also learn how to apply these concepts to various physical systems and devices.\r\n\r\n	6.728 taught an engineering approach to quantum mechanics and statistical physics. The class stressed applications of material learned rather than theory and proofs. 	Lectures\r\nProf. Orlando	Too many topics	Students took this class because they were interested solid state devices.  The class also helped many students with their research and statisfied a TQE requirement for graduate students.  6.728 is a pre-requisite for 6.730.	The problem sets were challenging but manageable.  They were essential in preparing for the exams and quizzes.		Grades were divided evenly between problem sets, quizzes, and the final.	The textbook, &quot;Introduction to Applied Quantum and Statistical Physics&quot; was very helpful in learning the class material.  It followed the class closely though it was fairly hard to read at times due to large amounts of equations and the lack of figures.	The quizzes were fairly written and manageable.  Some students felt the time was too short when taking the exam.  Questions were similar to ones found on the problem sets.	"[The TA] is a quantum physics encyclopedia."\r\n\r\n"Hats off, Bill!"	Because there were so many topics in the class, the material moved too quickly for some students.  Providing class notes would be helpful for students, so they don't have to copy off the blackboard during lecture and can concentrate on what is being taught.	https://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/6/fa06/6.728/index.html 	f	f	\N	12	0	\N	\N	\N

Students in 6.825 learned about a variety of topics in modern AI including resolution refutation, Bayesian networks, and Markov decision processes.  The class focused on exposing students to a wide body of theory rather than specific applications.\r\n	Lozano-Perez's jokes	Long projects	Most students took 6.825 because of a general interest in AI and cognitive processes or to further their own research.  Several students also cited the fulfillment of the TQE requirement as motivation for taking 6.825.\r\n		6.825 treated a series of projects as lab work.  Projects were directly relevant to material covered in class, and forced students to understand topics thoroughly.  The pseudocode for labs ranged widely in quality, with some of the more poorly written pieces of code frustrating students.\r\n	Grades were composed of a midterm (20%), four projects (50%), and a final (30%).  Extra credit on projects was generously available and grading was both reasonable and fair.	Opinions of 6.825's textbook (&quot;Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach&quot; by Russel and Norvig) were mixed.  Some students enjoyed the textbook immensely while other students complained that it was at times sparse and not detailed enough.  For topics not covered adequately by the textbook, students said that course notes and handouts needed improvement.  In addition, some students recommended supplementing the textbook with viewing lecture videos from past years.\r\n	The midterm and final were both open-book.  Students described them as fair and reasonable.  Both tested understanding of the material well and sample quizzes and problem sets gave a good indication of what to expect.\r\n\r\n\r\n  	"Great intro to AI."\r\n"Very interesting"	  Students wanted to see more concrete examples and would welcome thorough course notes.\n  In addition, one student recommended to reduce the size of projects, but increase their number, allowing for quicker feedback as techniques are learned.\n		f	f	AIA	12	0	\N	\N	\N

The course includes: Review of Maxwell's equations, light \r\npropagation, and reflection from dielectric and multilayer structures.  Interference, \r\ninterferometers, filters, optical systems.  Scalar Fresnel and Fraunhoffer diffraction \r\ntheory.  Propagation of Gaussian beams and laser resonator design.  Optical waveguides \r\nand optical fibers.  Optical waveguide devices.\r\n\r\nThe objective of this course is to train students in fundamental concepts and techniques \r\nwhich would be necessary for future research.  This course is essential for anyone who \r\nwill be performing research, engineering and development in the optics, optoelectronic \r\ndevices, quantum electronics, spectroscopy, or photonics.  However, the course may be too \r\nrigorous for students interested in a low level survey course.\r\n\r\nGrading is based on 10 problem sets, 2 quizzes and a final examination.  The text for the \r\ncourse is &quot;Waves and Fields in Optoelectronics&quot; by H. A. Haus.  Collaboration on problem \r\nsets is permitted, but use of &quot;bibles&quot; is not allowed and is considered cheating.\r\n\r\nTypically the course has ~15 students.  The course was smaller than usual this semester, \r\nbut this provided an opportunity for more in class discussion and interaction.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N		\N		f	f	EEE	12	0	\N	\N	\N

Applications are drawn from aerospace, mechanical, electrical, and chemical engineering, biology, and materials science. Topics include mathematical formulations; network problems; sparse direct and iterative matrix solution techniques; Newton methods for nonlinear problems; discretization methods for ordinary, time-periodic and partial differential equations, fast methods for partial differential and integral equations, techniques for dynamical system model reduction.\r\n\r\nCourse philosophy: emphasis is on &quot;learning by doing&quot; rather than on theory. Students learn how to solve practical large problems. The problem sets lead them through the development of their own circuit, thermal and mechanical simulators. \r\nThe problem sets will require lots of programming (mostly in Matlab).\r\n\r\nCollaboration policy: collaboration is highly encouraged, however each student must write his/her own code and problem set report independently.\r\n\r\nGrading policy: the class grade is mainly based on the problem sets. Everybody can get an A if they complete ALL problem sets in a satisfactory way, showing effort and understanding.	This class taught the fundamentals of  numerical simulations. The breadth of coverage was wide and was applicable and practical. Topics included linear and nonlinear systems of equations, time integration methods, boundary element methods and a very brief introduction to finite differences and finite elements.

Others did it to get an introduction to numerical methods or to apply to their research.	Problem sets were very time consuming, but many students found them useful (if not required) for learning the material. Students found collaboration to be extremely helpful, if not necessary for some problem sets. 		Grading was fair and based on effort.	The only notes provided for the class were Powerpoint slides. A fair portion of students found that the notes were enough for the class but some found that they were not comprehensive enough. There was no textbook, which was understandable because the breadth of the topics covered was too great to be covered in one textbook.	There were no exams.	"Tarek deserves a 10 ... he made some of the most difficult concepts as crystal clear as a Carribean blue sky."\r\n\r\n"You can make your own SPICE circuit simulator!"	Students wanted a unified and comprehensive set of lectures notes, or even a textbook that would cover the subjects.

Computer architecture\r\ncontinues to be a dynamic and rapidly evolving field. We emphasize the\r\nbroad array of factors that influence architecture including\r\ntechnology, applications, and software systems.  We describe a wide\r\nrange of architectural mechanisms and show how they arose given the\r\ndesign constraints at the time, and how old ideas can become\r\nattractive again as technology changes. Our goal is to help you\r\nunderstand not just the &amp;quot;what&amp;quot; but also the &amp;quot;why&amp;quot; and the &amp;quot;why now&amp;quot; behind the various mechanisms to prepare you for future developments.\r\n\r\nThe class is aimed at all systems students, not just those planning to\r\nspecialize in computer architecture.  In particular, the class\r\nprovides essential background for those wishing to write software that\r\nperforms well on modern systems.  This class is primarily geared\r\ntowards graduate students and seniors, and is often used by doctoral\r\nstudents to satisfy a TQE requirement. Students should have some\r\nundergraduate knowledge of computer architecture (6.004) and a\r\nrudimentary knowledge of basic logic design. Some undergraduate-level\r\nknowledge of operating systems and compilers can be helpful as well.\r\n\r\nTopics may include: instruction set design; processor\r\nmicro-architecture and pipelining; cache and virtual memory\r\norganizations; protection and sharing; I/O and interrupts; in-order\r\nand out-of-order superscalar architectures; VLIW machines; vector\r\nsupercomputers; multithreaded architectures; symmetric\r\nmultiprocessors; memory models and synchronization; embedded systems;\r\nand parallel computers.  Students interested in implementing these\r\nideas are encouraged to take 6.375 Complex Digital Systems, offered in\r\nthe Spring.\r\n	This class covers similar topics to 6.004, however it goes into greater detail about real life processors.  It was up to date and went into great depth.  Some students missed labs similar to those from 6.004 while others found all the detail tedious.	Interesting material\r\nLearning about actual hardware\r\nNo required homework\r\nNo final\r\nSimple course grade breakdown\r\nKrste	Lecture notes hard to follow\r\nLong problem sets\r\nConfusing problem sets\r\nHard quizzes\r\nToo many quizzes \r\nNo unifying theme or &quot;big picture&quot;	Students took this class because they were interested in learning about computer systems, because it was relevant to their work or to satisfy a requirement.  Students would recommend this class if you really liked 6.004.	Problem sets were not required, however they were similar to the quizzes and useful for learning the material.  They were long and hard, and sometimes the solutions were unclear.	\N	Grading was based equally on five quiz grades.  Some would have liked less quizzes and a problem set or take home exam.	Readings were assigned from &quot;Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach&quot; by Hennessy and Patterson.  Most students did not find the textbook useful because there were lecture notes.  Some students liked the class notes but others found them difficult to follow.  Students said class attendance was necessary to understand the lecture notes.	Quizzes were generally seemed as fair and similar to the problem sets, but some of them could be difficult and long.  Some students wished they had more time on quizzes.  Some students thought grading was harsh on the quizzes and that it was hard to get partial credit.	"All the stuff you didn't learn in 6.004 - i.e. how processors are *really* implemented in the non-Beta universe."	Students wanted cleaner lecture slides, clearer problem set solutions and shorter quizzes, or more time on quizzes.		f	f	CSA	12	4	\N	\N	\N

The results from the\nofficial MIT evaluations can be found at\n&lt;https://web.mit.edu/acadinfo/sse/evaluations/F06/c6/s6_804.html&gt;.\n\nThis class centered on computational models of human learning and reasoning, relevant\nartificial intelligence and machine learning approaches, and connection between these\nfields. Sate-of-the-art research is emphasized, along with classic work. This class is\nmost appropriate for advanced undergrads or beginning grads.  A class (or equivalent\nbackground) in probability and statistics is necessary. Experience in cognitive science\nand AI or machine learning is helpful. Extensive programming experience is not necessary\nbut the more comfortable you are with programming the easier it will be. Matlab is also\nuseful to know. Students learn to think about how human cognition works in computational\nterms, and learn how to evaluate machine learning and AI approaches in terms of their\ncognitive plausibility and relevance. If there is one message to take home, it is the\nimportance of sophistication in both learning algorithms and knowledge representations.\nStatistical inference and learning algorithms are complementary to, not opposed to,\nrichly structural knowledge representations.\n\nStudents are allowed to work together on class assignments, although each student must\nturn in their own independent write-up.  Undergraduates and graduate students are graded\nseparately.  In previous years the grade\ndistribution has been approximately 60-65% A, 30-35% B, 5-10% C.	6.804 taught Bayesian inference, Bayesian networks, optimization methods, concept learning, and other AI techniques used to derive results that resemble how humans process problems.  Subject matter was introduced through lectures, problem sets, and extensive readings.	Interesting examples\r\nProblem sets	Long, difficult problem sets\r\nOrganization of class\r\n	Students took this class because they were interested in the overlap between Course VI and Course IX, and wanted a more statistical approach to AI than presented in 6.034.\r\n	Problem sets were where a majority of learning in 6.804 occurred and helped students learn the material.  The problem sets were described as long and difficult, and some students disliked the MATLAB portion of the assignments.  Collaboration helped on problem sets. 	\N	Some students who responded were unaware of or unhappy with the grading policy.  A reason cited by a student was that grades were completely determined by only two problem sets and a final project.  \n	The optional readings in 6.804 were not very well tied to the class.  Although some of the readings themselves promoted an overall understanding of the field, they were not needed to perform well in the class or on the problem sets.\r\n	There were no exams.	"Good balance of theory and applications."\n\n\n	  6.804 students wanted smaller, more frequent problem sets that were spaced out throughout the term.\n  In addition, students took issue with the fact that readings were not adequately tied to the class.  Organizing the readings by topical importance and directly discussing the readings in lecture would go a long way to addressing these concerns.\n		f	f	CCS	12	0	\N	\N	\N

Problem domains include data structures, computational geometry, network flows, linear programming, and \r\napproximations for NP-hard problems. Computational models include the standard sequential \r\none, online algorithms, external memory, streaming algorithms, and parallel algorithms. \r\nThis subject will help anyone who encounters computational problems that need to be \r\nsolved efficiently - i.e. people in nearly every domain of computer science. It will give \r\npeople a cookbook of techniques that can be applied to their problems, a sense of how to \r\nformulate those problems for solution, and an ability to read the literature to find \r\nalready existing solutions. It will be useful to students in all domains of CS and \r\nrequires basic background in algorithms (6.046). Some very elementary probability (6.042) \r\nis also assumed. My goal is to convey to students the sense that many of the problems \r\nthey encounter can be effectively tackled using the algorithm toolbox of solution \r\ntechniques and pre-existing solutions. I'd place equal importance on the set of tools we've covered in the course and the ability to find and use new tools as new problems are \r\nencountered.	This class covered many different kinds of algorithms and was mostly theoretical. Despite the heavy focus on theory, students found the course staff helpful in explaining how the theory may be applied to actual practical uses. Students also found the subject matter engaging and fun.	Karger\r\nFun problems \r\nNo quizzes	Long, tough problem sets\r\nTime sink	Most students took this course because they had an interest in algorithms. Others took it to fulfill an Meng or TQE requirement.	Problem sets were long and hard and most students ended up working with a partner or small group. Problem sets were essential for a solid grasp of the course concepts and were the main part of the class.  Graded problem sets were also not returned promptly.	Students wished they had more time to work on the final project.		The class notes were somewhat useful but highly variable in quality due to the fact that they are written by students.  Many students would have preferred a textbook.	There were no exams.	"Problem sets are most of the grade and both long and extremely difficult.

The class covered a wide range of topics related to optimization methods and provided a general overview of the subject.  Linear optimization was discussed in detail, while non-linear optimization was only touched upon briefly. The class was highly theoretical with limited discussion of applications; some students desired a greater focus on practical applications of the material. Material was introduced through a series of proofs.	Balance between breadth and depth\r\nUseful homework\r\nGood lectures	Too much theory\r\nNumber of topics\r\nNot enough non-linear programs	Students generally took this class because they were interested in optimization or because it was related and helpful to their own research  The class also satisfied graduation requirements for some students.	Problem sets were useful in that they forced students to go over the material presented in lecture in greater detail.  Students found this helpful as the concepts presented in lecture were usually not immediately understood.  Many students collaborated in small groups to solve problems or check answers, and found that collaboration was enhanced their understanding. There were some difficult and time-consuming problems as well as problems involving proofs.		Students felt that the grading was fair, and that the relative weights given to homework and exams were acceptable. Too little feedback was given on problem set grading.  Grades were determined by problem sets (30%), the midterm (30%), and the final (40%).	The textbook, &quot;Introduction to Linear Optimization&quot; by Bertsimas and Tsitsiklis, was very useful but dense and difficult to digest. The book may be improved by providing more examples and applications. A textbook on non-linear methods would also be useful as the textbook does not cover all of the topics presented in class.  The class notes were more concise, but very useful as well. The notes helped clarify concepts presented in class and were especially helpful towards the end of the term.	Quiz questions were thought to be more difficult than the problem sets, and many students felt that there was too much time pressure on the midterm. They were satisfied with the length of the final exam. Although difficult, students generally felt that the exams were fair.	"Good overview. Awesome oportunity to read a pretty good book on optimization. Good to try out some things, get some more 'feeling' of what one can expect from optimization."	Students want more practical examples, and more depth, even if this means cutting down on the breadth of the course.	http://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/15/fa06/15.093/index.html	f	f	none	12	0	\N	\N	\N

This subject is primarily about learning, designing, and analyzing basic algorithms and was a mathematically oriented class, which many students found interesting but some found frustrating.  It was a theoretical class but many of the algorithms presented have useful applications in computer science.	Interesting Material\nFun Problems \nTake Home Quiz\nErik Demaine\nLectures	Difficult Material\nTake Home Quiz\nDifficult Problem Sets and Quizzes\nEarly Lecture\nMandatory Recitation	Many students took the class because it satisfies a requirement for VI-2 or VI-3 majors.  Others also cited independent interest as motivation for taking the class.  Several students suggested not taking the class unless you are prepared to work hard.	The problem sets were described as useful, but also difficult and often long to write up. Many students suggested collaboration to solve the more difficult problems.	\N	Most students thought the grading was fair, but some thought it was too harsh.  Many students complained about too little partial credit. Some found it vague, and hard to understand the correlation between their work and their homework grades (which were a check minus, check, check plus system).	Most students who used the textbook, &quot;Introduction to Algorithms&quot; by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein, described it as extremely good, but some preferred to rely on class notes.	The first quiz was an in class quiz, which was described as moderately difficult but basically fair.  The second quiz was a week long take home quiz which seemed extremely difficult and long.  Some students found it interesting, but many found it stressful and expressed their frustration with it.	"Awesome algorithms to solve crazy problems"\r\n\r\n"It was required for graduating, but it is a great great great class."	Students wanted more time between problem sets, and less penalties for late problems sets.  \nAdditionally, many requested a later lecture time.\n\nAlso, one student suggested to &quot;Separate the class into course 18 and course 6 majors (2 separate sections), as course 18 have had MUCH more preparation than any course 6.&quot;  This was a comment echoed earlier in the prerequisite section as many students suggested a more mathematical background than many course 6 majors may have had.	http://theory.lcs.mit.edu/classes/6.046/ 	t	f	TCS	12	0	\N	\N	\N

The first half is devoted to various cellular transport mechanisms, including diffusion, osmosis, carrier mediated transport, and ion transport across cell membranes. The second half is devoted to the basics of signal transduction in neurons, including Hodgkin-Huxley model and action potential, myelinated and unmyelinated fiber, and biophysics of ion channels.\n\nThis course is a course 6 header for bioelectrical engineering concentration.  Students need to take this course to learn the basics of cellular physiology, in order to prepare further studies in this area. As an elective this course will provide quantitative insights on basic cellular physiology, as well as an introduction to the fundamentals of neuroscience.  \n\nStudents who are interested in biomedical / biological engineering / neuroscience as their future career path should take this course. We focus/stress more on quantitative understanding of biological systems, therefore requiring certain mathematical/engineering backgrounds at the level of 18.03 or 6.002. This course is great for students who thrive in projects / experiments, which is a significant part of the course. \n\nWe spend a lot of time in the projects, where students have a chance to apply what they learn in the lectures in solving the problem they chose. This is a great way to learn the two important themes. 1) Biological systems (cells) can be understood in quantitative terms. 2) Biological systems are complicated because of multiple driving forces / factors involved. \n\nWhile students are expected to submit their own work as homeworks and exams, projects are done in pairs collaborating toward the common goal. Students in a group will receive the same overall project grades. In doing so, students will learn how to collaborate with a partner, which is an important skill but not often taught or emphasized. Use of bibles (if there is any) is discouraged since students will lose the chance to test their own understanding before the exams, which usually contains new problems.\n\nThe main improvements of future 6.021 offerings would be 1) improving the projects 2) revising the course contents in order to reflect all the new development in the field.   \n 	6.021 covered physical transport across membranes through diffusion and osmosis and ion transport, including the Hodgkin Huxley model of action potential propagation. Opinion was mixed on the CI-M portions and lab/theory matching.	Professors/TAs\nHodgkin-Huxley\nProjects	Lectures\nLecture Notes\nLabs	Most students took 6.021 because it was an EE header and a BME subject. Some students took the class out of an interest in biomedical engineering.	Problem sets were useful, but long. Office hours were helpful for their completion.	Labs generally reinforced and expanded the material.  Opinion on their length was sharply divided between reasonable and extremely lengthy. Several students complained about poor lab equipment that was in short supply. 	Grading was generally considered fair, but some noted that that projects could be graded harshly.	The textbook was seen as very useful to understanding the course material. The lecture notes contained lots of figures with few explanations.

Students who received less than a C in either of those courses do not have adequate preparation for 6.011. Parts of 6.011 can tend to look a lot like 6.003 and 6.041 revisited and to some extent are. However in revisiting and extending that material the student is now exposed to and held responsible for increased sophistication and depth of understanding that goes well beyond mechanical manipulation of the equations. Students who say &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;quot;wake me up when we're done with the review&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;quot; are often caught still napping by the first quiz. The lectures on state-space models require that students be comfortable with basic matrix manipulations and eigenvalue/eigenvector properties covered in 18.03 (and further developed in 18.06). Regarding homework and collaboration, each student is asked at the beginning of the semester to choose between one of two options for the homework. In one option, homework is not handed in and is not graded (and of course not weighted in the final grade). With the second option, homework is handed in, graded, and weighted in the final grading. Collaboration on homework is permitted and encouraged, but students must list the collaborators on the homework.	The subject covered more advanced and theoretical topics in signals, communications and systems than 6.003 did.  Topics included transforms, DSP, feedback systems, estimation, and filters.  The emphasis was on theory, although applications were discussed.

Exams measured how well students understand course concepts by means of many T/F questions. Showing your work was essential for partial credit. Practice exams helped a lot.  Some said quizzes were very different from psets in form, but similar in difficulty.

They were time-consuming at times, but generally easy. Students found office hours to be quite helpful in showing them how to approach problems. Some students also collaborated on the problem sets.	The final project was done in groups. Students found it to be easy and not too involved. The project was helpful in solidifying the students' understanding of the material. However, students had mixed opinions on whether it was interesting, or too easy and not enough of a challenge.	The grading was generally fair and partial credit was generously given. Students were disappointed that harder and more time-intensive problem sets weren't worth more than the easier ones. Problem sets were a large fraction of the final grade in 6.00. Some students were concerned that because of this and the fact that most did well on the problem sets, they had trouble gauging how well they were doing in the class.	The lecture notes were generally helpful. Students were mixed in regards to the textbook: some found it useless, others found it helped them learn better.	The quizzes focused more on programming concepts, theory, and vocabulary rather than writing code. Some students felt the material on the quiz was arbitrary and did not relate to the focus of the problem sets. Students who did well on the problem sets and felt they understood the material did not necessary do well on the quizzes. However, other students felt that the quizzes were fair and relatively easy.

Opinion was divided on the theory/application balance: some felt it was too theoretical with not enough examples, while others felt their knowledge was versatile and could be applied to any programming language. The choice of Scheme as the language of instruction allowed students to learn concepts without being distracted by syntax, but some found it cumbersome and wanted to learn a more widely-used language. Overall, students found the course useful, but time-consuming.	Scheme\nProjects\nLearning programming skillz\nThe &quot;check&quot; button on problem sets\nProfessor Grimson's jokes	10 AM lectures\nTime consuming projects\nScheme\nNon-absolute grading policy	Most students took the class because it is part of the Course VI core requirements. Non-Course-VI students took it to improve their programming skills and computer science background. Many were recommended to take the class by upperclassmen or alumni.	The problem sets were extremely useful. They clarified the material taught in class but were not too difficult or time-consuming. They served as checkpoints for understanding the material. Some students found collaboration extremely helpful, especially for debugging, but stressed that copying code or using bibles was useless. Other students did not collaborate with others and used the problem sets as self-learning material.	The projects were difficult and time-consuming, but still fun and satisfying to complete. They greatly reinforced the material learned in class. Students felt the best strategy was to start early and do them a little at a time. Lab assistants and TA's were useful and generally made helpful comments and suggestions.	Grading was fair overall. Some students disliked being graded on a curve because they could not keep track of how their grades were being computed. The 95/100 cutoff for an A on the first quiz also upset a lot of students.	Opinion was divided on the textbook: some students used only their own notes and lecture notes and didn't consult the textbook, while others found the online textbook  an immensely helpful resource and used it as an alternative to the lecture notes and material.	Quizzes and exams were reasonably easy and tested the material well, although some students felt that it was unfair to test programming skills in a written test without a computer. Previous years' exams were useful in telling students what to expect and in familiarizing them with the testing style.

I also emphasize hands-on learning through the lab projects. \n\nI encourage students to work together. Many students learn better this way. However, the work they turn in must be written up individually. I take a neutral stance on bibles -- they can be helpful if used as an aid to learning.\n	6.002 was an introduction to electronic circuits and the basics of circuit analysis.

They enjoyed the interesting and practical material they learned and recommended the class to anyone interested in electronics. However, they said it is important to make sure to have enough time to commit to it and to start early on labs and problem sets.	The problem sets were very useful for understanding the course material though they were a bit too long and occasionally repetitive. 	Although lab assignments were long, time-consuming, and sometimes even painful, they were helpful in the learning of the class material. Students were frustrated that a lot of lab equipments were broken and that the LAs were not very helpful. 	The grading was fair, &quot;as fair as grading at MIT gets&quot; according a student, though a few students thought that the psets were worth too little to take them seriously and the exams too much. 	The textbook was helpful and useful though some students found it hard to go through the big book and find what they need. The lecture notes were excellent and many used them to refresh their memory. Opinion was divided on whether the textbook or class notes were more useful. Most students used both the textbook and the notes.	Quizzes were challenging and reasonably well-written. Most importantly, they accurately measured students' understanding. Quiz 1 was easy and Quiz 2 was hard and long. Overall it was fair. \n\n\n	"The textbook is awesome...everything is explained well and thoroughly, cover to cover. I love that textbook so much that I sleep with it under my pillow."\n\n"The labs themselves were fine, but most of the lab equipment is broken, so 80% of the time you spend on your lab will be trying to figure out if your circuit is broken or if the equipment is."\n	The blackboard lectures were better than the powerpoint ones and students suggested that powerpoint lectures should be avoided.

Starting with MOS transistors, the course develops of series of building blocks -- logic gates, combinational and sequential circuits, finite-state machines, computers and finally complete systems.  Both hardware and software mechanisms are explored through a series of design examples.\n\n6.004 is required material for any EECS undergraduate who wants to understand (and ultimately design) digital systems.  A good grasp of the material is essential for later courses in digital design, computer architecture and systems.  Before taking 6.004, students should feel comfortable using computers; a rudimentary knowledge of programming language concepts (6.001) and electrical fundamentals (6.002) is assumed.\n\nThe lab exercises and projects are intended to give students &amp;quot;hands-on&amp;quot; experience in designing digital systems; each student completes a gate-level design for a RISC processor during the\nsemester.  Access to workstations as well as help from the course staff is provided in the lab but it is possible to complete the assignments using Athena machines or one's home computer.  Students\nare encouraged to get help from others in understanding the material, but the designs and measurements they hand in must be their own work. 	6.004 began at the gate level and built up to a working processor. Topics also included digital logic, Turing machines, and virtual memory. The class mixed application and theory, with labs reinforcing the material covered in lecture. Students were excited about learning how computers work.	Terman\nBuilding the Beta\nLabs\nEasy	Quizzes\nDebugging\n	Most students took this class because it was a requirement for Course VI, but they also found it fun and interesting. Some took it just to get a basic idea how a computer works.	No psets.	The labs helped students learn the material better and most students enjoyed working on them. The labs allowed students to actually implement what they discussed in class to gain a much better understanding about how computers work. Though the labs weren't very hard conceptually, debugging sometimes took a long time. 	Grading was based on an absolute point system. Students felt the grading was lenient and fair, and many got A's. Students appreciated being able to precisely gauge how they were doing in the class at any time. Labs came with check buttons so students could make sure they were getting full credit before submitting their labs.	The optional textbook was not used by most students. The lecture slides and recitation notes were useful for studying,  though most students found them vague standing alone from the lectures. The online lecture videos were popular.	The lack of a final was uniformly popular among students. Students held mixed opinions about the quality of the quizzes. Some felt they were a fair assessment of their understanding of the material, while others felt they focused too much on numerical answers and were too easy. Most agreed that studying past quizzes and recitation problems helped in preparing for the quiz because the format and style of problems did not vary much from year to year.	"I just built a computer processor with friggin' MOSFETs."\n"Try to be more like Chris."\n"You build everything yourself from the ground up -- very satisfying."\n	Students lauded the online videos, but would prefer more text to accompany the lecture slides. Many were happy with 6.004 as it is.	http://6004.lcs.mit.edu/	f	f	core	15	4	\N	\N	\N

Opinions were divided, most students found the Matlab projects to be tedious and painful.  However, some students thought the projects were reasonable and a good extension on the materials learned in class.	Almost all the students commented that grading was fair.  Some thought the grading on the problem sets was quite lenient.  	The textbook was dense but was a good reference.  Some supplemental online material were useful for completing the problem sets.

There was a good balance between theory and application. 	Intersting material\nProjects\nOnline lecture notes\n	Exams\nProjeccts\nLong lectures\n	Students took the class because it was a requirement for Course VI-3 and a Course VI header. And also they were interested in the subject and wanted to get a good overview on the exciting field of Artificial Intelligence.\n	The problem sets were very helpful in understanding the material and the online tutor certainly served its purpose. Students liked the format of the easy &quot;learning the basics&quot; problems and the harder &quot;think more&quot; problems.	The projects were good for understanding the material. They were of reasonable length and had clear instructions. They were nice in complementing the psets and lectures. However, some found them dull and annoying.	The grading policy was fair/lenient; few students had any complaints.	The textbook was almost non-existant for the class even though there was one. Most students stuck with the class notes instead and found them to be more useful and helpful in learning the course material.	The exams were open book, open notes and so they really tested students' understanding of the material. They emphasized concepts and not memorization of details. However, some felt that the exams could have reflected better what was done in the psets and lectures. 		Students agreed that the exams should be more reflective of the content covered in class. They also said the TAs should be in sync with what the quizzes were going to cover because most if not all of what was focused on in recitations ended up not being useful for the quizzes. 	http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.034/ 	f	f	AIA	12	4	\N	\N	\N

The class contents include discrete and continuous random variables, conditional probability and expectation, Bernoulli and Poisson processes, Markov chains, laws of large numbers, and a brief introduction to statistical inference. It is a fundamental subject, useful in numerous domains, from engineering to management, that involve uncertainty.\n\nThis class is a requirement for some majors and an elective for others, although many Course VI students choose it as a math elective, because of its applicability to many domains of their major. Students need only have completed the Freshman calculus requirement to take this class. Students are allowed to collaborate and use various sources, but they need to disclose their collaboration and their sources.	The subject covered single and multivariable probability over both discrete and continuous variables.  Various probability distributions and processes were taught, and several applications were presented towards the end.  Other topics included a brief introduction to inference and estimation and asymptotics.  Students generally found the class to be a good mix of theory and application, and most found that the class met their expectations.	Lectures\nFaisal\nOrganization\nCourse 15 students	Mandatory recitation attendance\nPainful psets which can be time-intensive\nQuiz 2\nGrading policy	Most people took it because it was a requirement for their major or the Course VI MEng and a prerequisite for future classes.  Some people took it to get an understanding of probability and randomness.  Most students did not recommend the class to anyone for whom it is not required.	There were weekly problems sets that helped reinforce the material taught in class.  Students found that the problem sets could be long and difficult and take up a significant amount of time, but found that they were useful in learning concepts.  Collaboration was found to be extremely useful.	\N	Grades were assigned based on three quizzes (85%), the best 9 out of 10 problem sets (10%), and participation (5%).  Although many students found the grading fair, there were several common complaints, including the presence of a participation grade, the low weight on problem sets, and the lack of partial credit.\n\nStudents also did not like the grading policy on problem sets where only a select number of questions were graded; they preferred that the entire problem set be graded.	The course textbook, &quot;Introduction to Probability&quot; by Bertsekas and Tsitsiklis, was found to be somewhat useful and a longer version of the class notes/slides given out in lecture.  Students liked the worked-out examples and practice problems in the textbook.  Students loved that lecture slides were given out in advance, as they helped them to follow and understand the lecture.	There were two quizzes, which were generally considered difficult but a fair test of understanding.  Problems were similar to those on problem sets and students recommended reviewing your problem sets to prepare for the examinations.  Students generally felt that the first exam was too long and the second was reasonable, although a few students took the contrary view that the second exam was much harder than the first.	"If you did lots and lots of problems, then you will ace the exams."\n"What is it with probability classes deciding to randomly choose which problems on the p-sets to grade and count for points?"\n"The subject content is exactly what I expected."	Students suggested that more examples could be given in lecture and more emphasis could be placed on harder concepts.  Students also suggested that grading should reward partial credit and understanding more and that assigned grades for individual students should be independent of the performance of the entire class.	http://web.mit.edu/6.041/www/home.html	f	f	math	12	0	\N	\N	\N

The two themes of the course were Class-D Amps and the Canonical Cell. Students appreciated the opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge (mostly from 6.002) to building circuits. Some students felt that this was one of the best classes for practical hands-on work, since the logical and sensible presentations and the well-planned labs improved their understanding of what it means to be an engineer. It achieved the right blend of theoretical and practical knowledge with great pace, covering a wide variety of practical skills. For students with little prior experience in electronics, the class provided solid training for them to appreciate the field of electrical engineering.\r\n\r\nSome students wished that concepts in control and feedback theory could be covered in greater detail. Also, it would be better to give students the grading rubric for the checkoffs earlier. Some also suggested shortening some of the detailed work in the labs which was only tangentially related to the big ideas of class.	Helpful TAs\r\nProfessor Leeb\r\nLectures\r\nPractical labs	Long labs\r\nPainful debugging	Students took this to fulfill either the department lab, AUS or CI-M requirement, and also because of interest in the subject material and its reputation as a fun class.	There were no problem sets in this course.	The labs were directly related to the material in class and made up a large portion of the course. They were reasonably long, challenging, and rewarding. It was advisable to start labs early. The lab equipment was readily available.	While some students thought that Professor Leeb was more strict in grading design reviews than TAs, students generally believed that grading was fair since there were hard numeric cutoffs. Students also knew exactly how many points each part of a lab was worth.	The recommended class textbooks only served as references and the lecture notes and lab handouts covered all the materials needed in the course. Notes were only distributed in lecture.	There was only one open-book quiz for the course and students who went to lectures and did the labs generally managed the material well. Problems were reasonably straightforward and fair, even though some students wanted to have more time during the quiz.		Quiz could have less weight or broken down into smaller ones. TAs should show up on time and there should be more staffed hours.		f	t	dept_lab	12	\N	\N	\N	Not enough comments for summary.

The labs were especially educational since you had to figure out how to solve problems on your own. However there were also problems with the labs. Since it was the first year this class was taught as a CI-M, there were continuity issues, where changed labs left artifacts from previous years, and required you to infer design decisions in poorly doccumented code.	It was unclear how the grading translates to letter grades. Technical grades were never returned, leaving only writing grades. Very hidden for the most part.	The lecture notes and textbook are moterately useful at best. For the most part they were not needed and superfluous.	No quizzes		Stress good programming practices more.

The first half covers fundamentals of photography and electronic flashes, including experiments on application of electronic flash to photography, stroboscopy, motion analysis, and high-speed videography. During this period, students write five extensive lab reports and present one oral lab report. In the second half of the term, students work in small groups to select, design, and execute independent projects in measurement or photography that apply learned techniques.\n\nWhy should a student elect to take Strobe Lab? If you wish to improve your communication skills, if you wish to learn how to work effectively in a laboratory, or if you want to learn how to capture and investigate events that are too swift to be seen, then you will find the subject interesting. All of these (particularly the first two) are of great help if you will be conducting academic or applied research.\n\nWho should take Strobe Lab? Those who are interested in the subject matter should take the class. Those who want an easy lab should not. This subject is intended to challenge your ability to prepare a thorough engineering memorandum describing your work, create engaging images that communicate technical information, and plan and execute a multi-week project as one of a team of four. It takes time and effort to do these well, and we expect a solid 12-hour-per-week contribution from each student.\n\nThe philosophy of 6.163 is: &amp;amp;quot;Work hard, tell everyone everything you know, close a deal with a handshake, and have fun.&amp;amp;quot; (Prof. H. E. Edgerton)\n\nCollaboration Policy: Lab experiments are carried out in groups of 4. The 5 written lab reports, the oral lab report, the homework, and the quiz are individual efforts. On the reports and the homework, students must make a good faith effort to execulte the assignment on their own. If they need assistance after that, they may discuss methods and techniques with anyone else they choose, but the actual work (be it solving homework problems, writing text, plotting graphs, creating photographic prints, etc.) must be their own. The reports for the feasibility study and the final project are collective efforts of each lab group. \n\nNo major changes to the subject are anticipated for the Fall  2007 offering.\n	The course covered fundamentals of photography, strobe, stroboscopy, multiflash, and film development process. In the first half, students learned the relevant theory. In the second half, they worked on projects in measurement or photography that applied this theory. There was a little more emphasis on application than theory.\n	Photography\nBullet lab\nCool pictures\nStroboscopes\n	Long labs\nLab write-ups\n	Students took the class because it was an Institute Lab and also because they wanted to learn about photography. They noted that it was one of the few departmental labs that do not require difficult math and the material was rather easy.\n	There was only one problem set which was long but straightforward. It was useful in preparing for the sole exam in the class. 	The labs were fun and a great learning experience. The downside was that the labs were kind of tedious and writing lab reports was painful. 	The grading policy was fair.	No comment received.	There was one quiz for the class. It was easy and fair, yet it tested students' understanding of the material.\n		The class should keep the content interesting and new; basically keep up the great work. Some students said the lab reports could be made shorter. One suggested making this class a CI-M.\n		f	f	dept_lab	12	12	\N	\N	\N

There were weekly labs which students found to be useful and complemented the lectures well.  They provided extremely good hands-on experience and were considered very good in helping students learn.  However, they could be long and time-intensive, and students recommended starting on them early.	The grades were based on the weekly labs, a quiz, and a final project.

Class notes were provided in the form of lecture slides, which were found to be very clear, helpful, and sufficient for learning the material.	There was one quiz which was designed to test understanding of the material.  It was considered a fair test of the concepts learned in lectures and labs. A few students considered the quiz to be long.	"[I] Realised that the field [of speech recognition] is not as primitive as I anticipated it to be, given the lack of speech recognition apps in real world."\n\n"Paul is the best. :)"	It was suggested that it would be preferable for the distributed lecture slides to be in color rather than black-and-white since many points were clearer with the color presentation.	http://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/6/sp07/6.345/index.html	f	f	CCS	12	4	\N	\N	\N

The course includes a number of required labs, several of which are animal labs. 	6.022 provides an overview of Cardiovascular, Pulmonary and Renal systems, with qualitative and quantitative perspectives. Course material is balanced with both application and theory relating not only to how the systems work, but how they fail. Students felt this class served as a good introduction to physiology.	The labs (hands down)\nThe teaching\nThe material	Time commitment\nEvening Classes\nPowerpoint	Many students who were generally interested in physiology or medicine took this class as an introduction to Bioengineering, or as part of a BME minor. Others took it to help prepare for medical school.	The psets were useful on the whole for learning the course material. They were a little challenging, but doable working either by yourself or in groups. Office hours were especially helpful on the psets for material that was not directly covered in lecture. Many pset problems were reused from previous years.	The labs were well run and educational; they contributed a lot toward learning the subject material.  The labs were quite time intensive, and most students stayed for the two hours per week billed in the course catalog. Reactions were mixed on the exit lab reports, in which the entirety of the report was turned in immediately after the lab.	Grading was fair, with a lenient bell curve distribution.	The textbook was good for the most part, but perhaps not deep enough, especially for the quantitative aspects of the course. The course notes made up for this in general.	Predominantly on the fair side of hard, the quizzes and problem sets did not overlap 100%, but that is to be expected. Time was not usually an issue.	Dr. Mark will always teach this subject for he is immortal.\n	The main complaint with the teaching style was the overuse of powerpoint. Using the board ensures that the students can keep up with you. Making the course notes more comprehensive would be greatly appreciated as well.		f	f	BEC	12	2	\N	\N	\N

This class covered the fundamentals in Microelectromechanical devices (MEMS), design and fabricaiton. It covered a wide variety of topics and placed a good emphasis on applications. Some students thought that too many topics were covered in too little time, and would have preferred to study fewer topics in more depth. Overall, the class was more like an overview of the subject material.\n	Material\nProfessors and TA\nProject	Long problem sets\nShallow treatment of some topics\nTime	Most students took this class for their research in microelectromechanical devices (MEMS). They recommended the class to anyone who is interested in MEMS and wants to get a broad overview of the subject, but advised having the prerequisites.\n	Problem sets were useful in learning but long and fairly time-consuming. Some questions were just tedious work of drawing masks and cross sections over and over again, which did not help much in understanding. Collaboration was helpful to many students.	There were no labs but the midterm design project, which resembled the problem sets, and the final design project. The final design project was greatly appreciated because it got people thinking outside the box and utilizing many concepts taught in the class. It was a good capstone for everything students learned in class. While it took a lot of work and time, students were provided ample time to do it. \n	Students disliked the low contribution from psets (15%), given the amount of time and effort that went into them.  Aside from that, there were few complaints.	The opinion was divided on whether the textbook, &quot;Microsystem Design&quot; by Stephen D. Senturia was useful or not. Some thought it good and useful in explaining concepts, but others thought it was rather unclear and was written for those who have already mastered the subject. The class notes were very useful though they were quite similar to the textbook.\n	There was one take-home exam. The exam was  well designed and required a thorough understanding of fabricaiton and design of MEMS. 		The class covered so much so fast that some students were not able to grasp everything.

The hands-on experiments were a nice complement to the theory.  The write-ups were appropriate though people spent days on them.

Students had not yet received any grades.	There was no textbook for this class.  The class notes were printouts of Powerpoint slides from lecture.

Students basically had to write a one-page response to a paper chosen by Winston on the field of AI, and the responses took on different formats (e.g, a letter).  Students found that the papers were good preparation for the discussions in class and though helpful, it does become tiring having to write so much over a semester.

Most students had NO idea what the grading policy was and how it would translate into an A-F grade.	No textbook or notes for the class.  The readings for the class are all available online and are mostly theses in AI.  The papers varied greatly in length and interest.  	Officially, Winston has never confirmed or denied that there are quizzes for this class.

So lack of a grader made the grading policy rather unclear, and the amount of rigor required in writing up solutions was impossible to judge. 	The class used the textbook, &quot;Randomized Algorthms&quot; by Motwani and Raghavan. It was useful and helpful in learning the matierals. There were no scribe notes.

The course covers most of the topics in 6.431 (sample space, random variables, expectations, transforms, Bernoulli and Poisson processes, finite Markov chains, limit \ntheorems) but at a faster pace and in more depth. \n\nThere are also a number of additional topics such as: language, terminology, and key results from measure theory; interchange of limits and expectations; multivariate Gaussian distributions; deeper understanding of conditional distributions and expectations. \n\nThe course is geared toward students who need to use probability in their research at a reasonably sophisticiated level (e.g., to be able to read the research literature in communications, stochastic control, machine learning, queueing, etc., and to carry out research involving precise mathematical statements and proofs). \n\nOne of the functions of the course is to develop mathematical maturity. The course aims at developing in parallel probabilistic intuition and formal analysis of probabilistic models. A key objective is to develop the skill to translate intuitive informal probabilistic statements and arguments into precise ones. \n\nWhile the only formal prerequisite is 18.02, the course assumes some familiarity with elementary undergraduate probability and  mathematical maturity. A course in analysis would be helpful but is not required. Some familiarity with linear algebra is also useful. 	6.436 provided a good mix of applied and theoretical probability thory.

Topics covered included Bayesian methods, Markov random fields, Approximate inference methods, and object recognition.  Students felt the class focused primarily on applications rather than theory.	Freeman's lectures\nCurrent computer vision research	Tweaking parameters \nLengthy assignments\nTextbook	Almost all students had an interest in computer vision. A few also needed to satisfy requirements.	The problem sets were lengthy, but were very useful for learning the material. They were focused on implementation, which usually helped students with their understanding of the material but sometimes became tedious and frustrating. Their open ended nature made it difficult to evaluate if results were correct or incorrect. Most did not collaborate and found feedback to be lacking.	The final project encouraged students explore a topic in machine vision in depth.  Students enjoyed the project and felt they benefited from the experience. However, the project did require a fair amount of time. Students were free to choose their own topic, though those without research in machine vision would have appreciated more involvement from the staff in finding a topic.	The grading was fair overall, and forgiving on the exam.	The lecture notes were generally well-acclaimed and were made available online. The textbook had useful information, but students found that it was not well edited.	There were two exams for the class, both take-homes. Students appreciated being able to work on them without time pressure. The content focused on theory, unlike the application-centered problem sets. Students felt some problems did not relate directly to content presented in class, but were doable. Averages were quite high.	"I don't just learn 'what methods', but also learn 'how to think about a solution.'"\n"You get to learn from the guru of the field."	Students enjoyed the class overall. A few students suggested covering fewer topics in more depth. Lectures on related to Lecturer W. Freeman's research were the best.

The course is reading and project driven; students are expected to read papers from the original literature for each class, and to complete a series of projects.  Collaboration on the final project is allowed if clearly documented.  Depending on the class size, the class will be run as in lecture or seminar format.

The treatment of optical networks will be from the architecture and system design points of view. Optical hardware technologies will be introduced and characterized as fundamental network building blocks on which optical transmission systems and network architectures are based. In addition to the Physical Layer, the higher network layers (Media Access Control, Network and Transport Layers) will be considered together as integral parts of network design. Performance metrics, analysis and optimization techniques will be developed to help guide the creation of high performance complex optical networks.\n\nThis course formulates engineering problems in simple mathematical terms and then ask what are the implications of the analytical results. Students interested in research on optical networks and students who will enter the engineering work force will benefit from taking the course. Only probability background is required. Having taken 6.011 is a plus but not necessary.\n\nWe try to help the students to develop engineering maturity so they can recognize new technologies and their implications on architecture constructs and then be able to model and analyze these archtiectures.\n\nStudents are encouraged to collaborate on problem sets. They can use bible but we discouraged copying since they will not be thinking through the modeling and formaulation of the analytical problems.\n\nThe course will be taught again and we are still in the process of finishing its development. However, ~ 80% of the material will be the same.\n 	This class covered optical network architectures.  Students learned about different architecture topologies for networks and how to calculate efficiencies of different ones.

More the merrier.	8	14	5.70000000000000018	6	The primary aim of this course to provide mathematical tools and algorithms for signal representation.  Upon entering the course, students are expected to have some familiarity with classical Fourier techniques (e.g., at the level of 6.011).  The course adds some nuances to the students' understanding of Fourier techniques, but emphasizes the advantages of having time locality along with frequency locality.  It thus develops wavelet ideas, starting from discrete time and iterating to obtain continuous-time bases.  The course is not focused exclusively on wavelets; for example, it also presents contemporary views of sampling and the foundations of lossy compression.\n\nStudents interested in doing research in signal processing should take this course for a solid foundation in the mathematics of signal processing.  In addition, students who wish to apply modern signal processing tools to other research areas will benefit from seeing a variety of signal representations and learning about their relative merits.\n\nThe course has a midterm exam, but students are evaluated primarily on the quality of a research project.  Students should be prepared to put significant effort into the project; the staff is willing to provide guidance and feedback throughout the semester.	The class teaches basic signal processing concepts like filterbanks and polyphase representations and connects them with linear algebra concepts. Then, it shifts focus to the Discrete Wavelet Transform and then general wavelet bases. The second part of the course surveys various current fields and looks at different applications of those signal processing techniques. It is like a seminar class, with a relaxed atmosphere.	Interesting topics\nBreadth of coverage\nProf. Goyal's vast knowledge	Could be overwhelming at times	Students cited an interest in signal processing, and not wanting to graduate without knowing what a 'wavelet' is.	The problem sets were given once every two weeks, but once a week would have been better. They were relevant and useful, but difficult.	The final project was completely open ended. It was a good learning opportunity, letting students explore subjects they normally wouldn't.	The grading was fair.	None.	No Comments.	"Unlike many professors, [Prof. Goyal]'s a bit more interactive in class; provokes questions and notices his own mistakes."	Make the problem sets weekly. Spend less time on the mathematical foundations and more time on the continuous wavelet transform.		f	f	none	12	0	\N	\N	\N

The lab equipment was below expectation and time-consuming to set up.  The final project took more time than all three labs.  Instructions were confusing and expectations unclear.  However, TAs and the Professor provided wonderful help. \nOne student felt that almost all he learnt was Bluespec which was an impractical language. 	Opinions were divided. Some thought the grading was unfair because expectations were poorly explained.  Grading for the midterm seemed arbitrary with &amp;quot;massive amounts of points taken off for small errors and no credit for partial responses&amp;quot;.  Final project milestones were confusing.	None.	There was only one midterm which counted for 20% of the grade.

How fast can one cycle or swim?  How large is hydrogen?  How far can 747's and birds fly without refueling?  How do xylophones make tones?\nTo analyze such questions exactly requires difficult techniques: for example analysis of three-dimensional fluid flow over nasty boundaries.  However, with skillful approximations we can understand and explain diverse phenomena in the world around us.  This subject teaches these techniques of approximation, illustrating them using physics, chemistry, biology, and engineering examples in the world around us.  The techniques include divide-and-conquer reasoning, extreme cases, dimensional analysis, proportional reasoning, box models, balancing, and &quot;everything is a spring.&quot;\n\nToo often after years of studying science or engineering, the\nequations live in small compartments, one for each subject -- whether\nquantum mechanics, thermodynamics, or biochemistry -- or, worse, one\nfor each problem set in a subject.  But the world offers us its\npuzzles without respecting those boundaries.  This subject teaches\nmental tools -- methods of reasoning -- valuable across many subjects,\nhopefully connecting disparate pieces of knowledge into a web of\nlong-lasting understanding.  These techniques are the skills\ntransferable to other fields and examples.\n\nThese tools are valuable for research.  Research brings you to\nunexplored fields and unsolved problems.  The reasoning tools of\napproximation mitigate the paralysis when faced with the confusion of\na new problem.  Before doing a long calculation based on a conjectured\nmodel, it is helpful to know quickly whether the model is plausible.\nIf an approximate calculation using your model gives a result that,\nexperimentally, is inaccurate by five powers of ten, you know that a\ntime-consuming, accurate analysis cannot save the model.  So you\nquickly learn that you need a new model.  If, however, the approximate\nresult is close to the experimental data, then it is worth spending\ntime on more accurate calculations.  That's why you find, on\nblackboards of physics tea rooms all over the world, rough scrawls,\nsketches, scaling arguments, and back-of-the-envelope calculations.\n\nThe subject assumes familiarity only with first-year physics (mostly\nthe mechanics part) and a small amount of first-year calculus.  So\neveryone from sophomores to graduate students is prepared for this\nclass.  Those with extensive physics and engineering backgrounds may\nappreciate the short, intuitive derivations made possible by\napproximation.  Those with less background may learn ways of thinking\nthat will make the results in later classes seem intuitive.\n\nTeachers are guides who, at our best, spark our students' vast\nintellectual and emotional energy.  To that end, I used:\n\n1. Reading memos.  These were invented by MIT's Edwin Taylor [`Only\n  the student knows', American Journal of Physics 60:201-202 (1992)].\n  I handed the class a few pages from my draft textbook on the\n  subject, and students wrote comments and critiques marking places\n  that were confusing or wrong.  I like how reading memos hand power\n  to the students.  With reading memos, the students are the experts:\n  If a point is marked as confusing, then it needs to be fixed!\n\n2. Feedback forms, like the 'muddy cards' used in Aero/Astro.  During\n  the last five minutes of lecture, I asked students to answer four\n  questions (anonymously, on a half-sheet of paper): (1) What was the\n  main point today?  (2) What are you confused about?  (3) What\n  technique or example worked or didn't work?  (4) Any general\n  comments?  The answers were incredibly useful.  I began each\n  lecture by answering the confusing points from the previous\n  lecture, and the comments helped me to pace the lectures.\n\n3. In-class problem solving, similar to peer instruction [Eric Mazur\n  (1997), _Peer Instruction: A User's Manual_, Prentice Hall.]  I'd\n  give a conceptual problem, for example to predict the result of an\n  in-class demonstration, and ask students to discuss the candidate\n  answers with one or two neighbors, and then vote.  The\n  justifications for each choice seeded discussion about\n  problem-solving approaches.  Students are also encouraged to work\n  together on assignments.\n\nI hope that students, long after the details have faded, remember two\nideas.  First, when faced with large problems,\n&quot;divide and conquer&quot;.  Second, that &quot;when the going gets tough, the tough lower their\nstandards.&quot;  Often an approximate answer is more useful than an exact\nanswer, for an approximate answer is easier to understand and\ntherefore to use in making new designs or solving new problems.\n\nWhen I next teach this subject, I might give a final exam, possibly\noptional with an individual problem set as an alternative.  I'll give\nmore problem sets and create at least one in-class demonstration per\nweek.  I'll also have written more (all?) of the textbook, which will\nbe food for reading memos.  The memos will be due at 11pm on the\nevening before the lecture on that topic.  The aggregated comments\nwill help me prepare a lecture discussion based on students'\nquestions: for example, on the points that are most confusing and\ntherefore need extra examples or alternative explanations.	The class was an overview of approximation techniques and focused on examples to demonstrate approximation concepts.  The techniques learned in the class were applicable to many different fields and were based on intuition rather than technical details.	Classroom atmosphere\r\nInstructor\r\nBroad range of topics	No lecture notes or text	Students cited interest as a reason to take 6.084 and enjoyed the challenges posed by the class.

Keep it up Sanjoy!\n\nBe Sanjoy, or a reasonable imitation of him.\n\nI loved the way the class was run, and it can only get better from here. The instructor is extremely intelligent and passionate about what he teaches. He is a great lecturer, and encourages curiosity and wise thinking	The only real suggestion was what a student said: &quot;Lecture notes would be helpful. Emphasizing the amount of physics in the course description may be useful, since I didn't quite expect as much physics as there was. It worked out ok, though.&quot;\n	http://web.mit.edu/sanjoy/www/6.084-F2006/	f	f	none	12	0	\N	\N	\N

To exploit the potential contributions of improvements in our understanding of genomics, proteomics and the “new biology,” we must combine such data with the clinical data that represent the patient’s phenotype. We must also develop new analytical methods to find the important relationships among these data, and then apply them in many settings to improve health care.\n\nThese needs form an intriguing engineering challenge described in this class, along with methods and practices aimed at their solution.\n\nTopics:\n\nContemporary Medical Care: Purpose, methods, organization\nMedical Data: Types, organization, presentation, uses\nStandards: Terminologies, coding, natural language processing\nHealth Enterprise and National Infrastructures\nPrivacy: Data de-identification &amp;amp;amp; anonymization, geographic information, genetic data\nPublic Health &amp;amp;amp; Surveillance\nTelemedicine &amp;amp;amp; Medicine in the Developing World\nLearning Graphical Models\nAnalysis of Networks\nStatistical Signal Processing\nTemporal Inference Methods\nInformation-Theoretic Metrics\nBayesian Statistics\nDecision Support\n\nThe subject is for anyone interested in computing applications in health care and biomedicine.

Next year I hope to have a better formalized methods section of the course, taught earlier in the term, to form a solid basis for discussing applications later.

They also indicated that basic knowledge of communication theory is required.  	7	11	5	5.70000000000000018	This subject covers Digital Communication System design principles and digital integrated circuit implementations of various blocks in a communication system. It helps bridge the gap between the communication and signal processing theory and actual hardware implementations of digital communications systems.\nAll students who want to work or do research applying both communication theory and hardware design should take this class to understand the interaction of the two. If there is a single concept to be picked up from this subject, it is that only by looking across several levels of hierarchy - from theory and algorithm to the actual implementation can we best optimize the whole system. The teaching philosophy is that lectures give the basic translation from communication and signal processing theory into hardware implementations, tutorials provide the necessary tools to do digital chip design and a project of students choice puts everything together.\nStudents may collaborate on the project and problem sets as long as they go through all the parts. If this special subject is thought again, an undergraduate version with toned down theory will be offered.	The class taught both communication theory and its application to circuit design. Students appreciated the fact that the course bridged the gap between theoretical and practical elements of the topic. Some student felt that some of the material covered was too advanced for a first class in the field of communications. 	the material\nactual implementation of theory\nthe lecturer	too much detail\ntoo many topics\nnot enough help	Most students took the class because they wanted to obtain a high level overview of communication systems and how it relates to the design of networks. Some students took this class because it was useful for their research.	Students generally enjoyed the assignments and thought that they were useful in learning. They especially enjoyed the first project of fixing a broken 802.11 modem written in behavioral C. However, the class seemed to assign less work as the term went on, and students indicated that they did not get enough practice on later materials.	Labs had great facilities and good tools. They take a long time and need more documentation, but they are very practical and worthwhile overall.	Students all agreed that grading was fair.	There was no official textbook for the class, but lecture slides were online after class and students were pointed to an online textbook from Stanford. The lecture slides are good at covering the material, but some students said they were a bit too cluttered. They were also sometimes not online on time. The book from Stanford is good for the basic ideas, but it has too much detail and too much math, which sometimes confused the students.	Students agreed across the board that the two take home exams were reasonable in terms of both difficulty and time commitment. 	This course fills in what was lacking in the communication courses till now. \nFinally, MIT offers a class covering wireless networks that is not just pure theory and actually looks at the practical aspects of it's implementation.	In terms of class format, students asked for clearer notation in slides and exercises that let students correct code errors and complete codes instead of starting from scratch. Students also asked for more help from TAs.\nIn terms of class material, students wanted more details with concrete examples. 		f	f	none	12	0	\N	\N	Objectives were clearly defined with an outline at the beginning of term and were followed through.

Students mostly took this class to satisfy requirements, though many expressed interest in algorithms or a desire to become more employable.	The six psets were absolutely essential to learning the course material.  Problems were mostly well-written and always challenging.  Most students collaborated, but only one reported the use of a bible.    They wished graders would have provided more detailed feedback on the psets.  	None.	Grades were based on problem sets (16%), an in-class quiz (16%), a take-home quiz (31%), and a final exam (37%).  Many students thought the grading on the take-home quiz was too harsh, and that it shouldn't have been curved.  However, the overall grading policy was fair.	The class notes were very popular.  The textbook was thorough but perhaps too wordy -- it often worked better as a reference than as a way to learn the material.	There were two quizzes.  The first was given in class, and was slightly easier than the problem sets.  Quiz 2 was the infamous week-long 6.046 take-home exam, which tested students' ability to design their own algorithms.  It was challenging, rewarding, and much more time-consuming than advertised by the instructors.	It's frustrating that they can't just teach us to get smarter, which is what this class really requires.;\n	The 9:30am lecture time was simply too early in the morning for most students.\n\nRegarding the take-home exam, opinions were sharply divided.  Some suggested getting rid of it altogether while others thought it was the best part of the class. The desire for more feedback from the graders was shared by students on both sides of this debate.	http://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/6/fa07/6.046/index.html	t	f	\N	12	0	\N	\N	The syllabus presented clear objectives, which were followed closely.

You'll learn about combinational and sequential logic, memories, and how to interface to the external world (eg, audio, video and other analog data).  We use a labkit with a high-performance field programmable gate array which you configure with different circuits described using the Verilog hardware description language.  We cover the basics of finite state machines, arithmetic circuits, digital signal processing, microsequencers, etc.  After completing 5 labs to get you up to speed on the techniques and tools, the last six weeks of the course are devoted to working with a small team on a final digital systems project of your own choosing.	6.111 taught how to design complex digital circuits and how to use Verilog.

Lab 3 and the final project, however, required a lot of time.  Students complained that compiling Verilog ate up a lot of their time, and that lab equipment was often buggy and unreliable.  Students emphasized the importance of starting the final project early.	Students thought the grading seemed fair, but expressed uncertainty because they had not yet received their grades for their final projects.	There was no required textbook.  Lecture slides were available online, and most students found them useful for review.  Some students recommended the Fall 2005 website as an additional resource.	There was one exam.  It was relatively straightforward and simply tested the students for a basic understanding of Verilog.  Students who completed the labs had no problem with this exam.		The CI-M part of the class should have been either ditched or modified.  Students also suggested balancing out the time commitment more evenly throughout the class.  Some said that it would have been nice to have assigned lab stations (to prevent fighting over lab equipment) and longer lab hours.

Applications are drawn from aerospace, mechanical, electrical, and chemical engineering, biology, and materials science. Topics include mathematical formulations; network problems; sparse direct and iterative matrix solution techniques; Newton methods for nonlinear problems; discretization methods for ordinary, time-periodic and partial differential equations, methods for partial differential and integral equations, techniques for dynamical system model reduction.\n\nCourse philosophy: emphasis is on 'learning by doing' rather than on theory. Students learn how to solve practical large problems. The problem sets lead them through the development of their own circuit, thermal and mechanical simulators. \nThe problem sets will require lots of programming (mostly in Matlab).\n\nCollaboration policy: collaboration is highly encouraged, however each student must write his/her own code and problem set report independently.\n\nGrading policy: the class grade is mainly based on the problem sets. The class is not 'curved', i.e. everybody could potentially get an A if they complete ALL problem sets in a satisfactory way, showing effort and understanding.	A broad range of techniques for numerical simulation are covered. The class is geared towards students who are new to the field but have a solid understanding of linear algebra.  Problems sets are the primary vehicle for learning, covering both theoretical concepts and application examples.  It was a good preparation for using methods of numerical simulation in other coursework or research projects.	No exams\nProfessor Luca Daniel\nKrylov subspace methods	Confusing lecture slides;\nNo textbook;\nLong problem sets	Most students who took this class wanted to learn the basics of numerical simulation because of its broad areas of application, though some had a specific research project in mind already.  Also, this class satisfies a Course XVI math requirement.	There were only six psets, so they were lengthy and time-consuming.  The problems did a good job of reinforcing the course material, and asked you to think beyond what was presented in lecture.  Most students collaborated but did not use a bible.  	None.	The grading policy was very fair.  It was mostly based on problem sets, but also included class participation.	There was no textbook for this class.  Online lecture notes contained most of the relevant material, though they could have been better organized.	There were no quizzes.		Students wished for more clear and detailed online notes, as the class had no textbook.

What does the subject cover:\n\nThis course covers the fundamental principles of the processes used in the fabrication of devices for silicon integrated circuits, and how these processes are integrated together to form state-of-the art Si CMOS.  The course covers both advanced physical models and practical aspects of major processes such as thermal oxidation, solid-state diffusion, ion implantation, epitaxial growth, etching, and silicides.  In particular, advanced models for diffusion (transient enhanced diffusion) and ion implantation are emphasized.  The impact of processes and process integration on device characteristics (e.g. reverse short channel effect) is also discussed.  Focus is on physical understanding, with exposure to concepts used in process modeling and simulation.  A lecture is included on strained Si CMOS and SiGe growth and processing issues.  Students are given the opportunity to use a modern process simulator in the homework assignments and in the Final Project.\n\n\n2.  Is this a required subject?\n\nThis subject is not required.  However, it is strongly recommended for anyone considering a career in or related to microelectronics/microfabrication, and for graduate students doing research in that area.  Students interested in integrated optoelectronics, microphotonics, and nanofabrication will also benefit from a thorough understanding of modern CMOS processing.\n\n3. Who should take this course, and what are the pre-requisites?\n\nThe course is geared towards graduate students, however it can be taken by advanced undergraduates as well as masters students and Ph.D. candidates.  It is helpful to have exposure 6.152J, but this is a recommendation and is not required (the text is complete enough to take care of background issues).  Students who have been exposed to basic concepts of the MOSFET (e.g. 6.012) will better appreciate the in-class examples on how processing impacts devices.  Students who have taken 6.152J will find some overlap with this course in the beginning, but additional depth is included in 6.774.\n\n4.  What is the teaching philosophy for the course? If students keep one or two concepts from this subject, what do you hope they will be?\n\nThe teaching philosophy for this subject is to combine fundamental physical background with modeling techniques as well as exposure to “practical” aspects.  The textbook by Plummer et al, does a good job of this.  In addition, material from recent conference publications is added to the lectures, to expose students to practical use of the concepts in the course.  Another part of the teaching philosophy in this subject is that students need to gain experience using modern simulation tools (such as SUPREM) in order to better understand how the models work in practice.  Homework assignments emphasize checking the results of simulations against hand calculations, where possible, to make sure that the simulations make sense.  Students are given a chance to practice their public speaking skills by doing a polished oral presentation at the end of the semester (in place of a written report).  Key concepts include: (1) the fundamentals and modeling of oxidation, diffusion, ion implantation and transient diffusion, and (2) physically-robust models (as opposed to ‘fitting’) and how they can predict complex processes and interactions among processes in a CMOS fabrication flow, as demonstrated by exercises using the SUPREM simulator.\n\n5.  What is the collaboration policy for this course?\n\nStudents learn best in this area by discussing ideas with each other.  Collaboration is allowed and encouraged.\n\n6. If you teach this subject again, will it be different?\n\nThe syllabus as well as some of the details of the material is updated each time since the field changes rapidly. \n\n	6.774 covered major aspects of modern semiconductor fabrication, which include oxidation, diffusion, ion implantation, etching and so on. There was a particular emphasis on topics most related to electronic device construction, along with an introduction to the simulation methods used to describe them.

Problem domains include data structures, computational geometry, network flows, linear programming, and approximations for NP-hard problems. Computational models include the standard sequential one, online algorithms, external memory, streaming algorithms, and parallel algorithms.\n\nThis subject will help anyone who encounters computational problems that need to be solved efficiently - i.e. people in nearly every domain of computer science. It will give people a cookbook of techniques that can be applied to their problems, a sense of how to formulate those problems for solution, and an ability to read the literature to find already existing solutions. It will be useful to students in all domains of CS and requires basic background in algorithms (6.046). Some very elementary probability (6.042) is also used.\n\nMy goal is to convey to students the sense that many of the problems they encounter can be effectively tackled using the algorithm toolbox of solution techniques and pre-existing solutions. I'd place equal importance on the set of tools we've covered in the course and the ability to find and use new tools as new problems are encountered.\n\n	6.854 covered a broad selection of algorithm-related topics, which included persistent data structures, splay trees, van Emde Boas trees, Fortune's algorithm, and linear programming. Students felt that the content was well selected.	Professor Karger's lectures\nNo exams\nInteresting topics	Long and hard problem sets\nLarge time commitment	Students took 6.854 primarily because they wanted more exposure to algorithms beyond what is covered in 6.046. It also satisfies the TQE requirement for doctoral graduate students.	Problem sets were long, difficult and time consuming, but helpful for learning the material. Many students found collaboration helpful, though some students did not feel the need to collaborate. 	No labs.	The grading policy was fair.	There was no textbook for this class. The quality of the scribe notes that were provided online varied greatly in quality from excellent to poor, but served as a useful reference.	No quizzes.	Sadly, there is no real other way to learn the things taught in this course. So, as I wanted to learn more algorithms, I had to take it.\nWe learned advanced algorithms. \nGood exercises [on psets].	Students suggested that specific reading assignments be given for each lecture. A high level overview of each topic in lecture would have been helpful before delving into the details. The scribe notes should be updated and fleshed out. Also, regular weekly office hours would be more inviting than the current office hours by appointment scheme.	http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.854/current/	f	f	TCS	12	0	\N	\N	The objectives of this class were clear and well followed throughout the class.

Problem sets were generally considered difficult and long. However they were well-desigined, reinforced the subject material, and helped the studetns understand it better. Collaboration was also generally considered helpful, though not many were able to find others to work with. 	Labs were generally considered to be very useful and helped understand concepts. The final project was fun, and provided great practical experience. 	The grading policy was generally considered very fair and reasonable. The mean was set to be the A/B boundary. 	Class notes were generally considered to be very helpful, self-sufficient, well-organized and clear.  They also provided references for further readings. As a result they were substitute for a textbook.  	The midterms were open book, and generally considered very difficult, but the grades were scaled accordingly.  You need to really understand the problem sets and the material discussed in class in order to do well.

The first half covers fundamentals of photography and electronic flashes, including experiments on application of electronic flash to photography, stroboscopy, motion analysis, and high-speed videography. During this period, students write five extensive lab reports. In the second half, students work in small groups to select, design, and execute independent projects in measurement or photography that apply learned techniques.\n\nIf you wish to improve your communication skills, if you wish to learn how to work effectively in a laboratory, or if you want to learn how to capture and investigate events that are too swift to be seen, then you will find the subject interesting. All of these (particularly the first two) are of great help if you will be conducting academic or applied research.\n\nThose who are interested in the subject matter should take the class. Those who want an easy lab should not.\n\nIf you only keep  two concepts from the class, I hope  that first would be that project planning will make your life easier and that you can create amazing things with your hands by paying attention to what you are doing and working with care.\n\nThe philosophy of 6.163 was set by the late Prof. Harold Edgerton: &amp;amp;amp;quot;Work hard, tell everyone everything you know, close a deal with a handshake, and have fun.&amp;amp;amp;quot;\n	This class teaches how to photograph high-speed events with electronic flash sources.  There is a strong emphasis on teamwork and communication skills, especially writing.	Cool labs\nOpen-ended final project\nWorking in groups	Tedious lab reports\nPicky grading	Most students took this class because it was an Institute Lab with a reasonable time requirement, and because they were interested in strobe photography.  	There was one homework assignment, which was described as easy but very useful in studying for the quiz.  A few students collaborated but nobody reported the use of a bible.	Labs were useful, interesting, and fun.  Though labs were not too difficult, they consumed a lot of time.  Students especially complained about the length of the lab reports.	Grades were based on lab reports (30%), in-class work and a problem set (10%), a quiz (10%), a feasability study (15%), and a final project (35%).	None.	There was one quiz.  Students felt that it was fair, and recommended that the problem set was the best way to study.	I learned how to write lab reports, project plans, and work in, present with, and write a paper with a large group. I also learned about photography; Lots of fun.\n\n	The grading of lab reports may have overemphasized formatting details.  There was also a suggestion to shuffle the groups occasionally so that students can work with different people throughout the semester.	http://web.mit.edu/6.163/www/	f	t	dept_lab	12	12	\N	\N	A clear list of objectives was handed out at the beginning of the semester, and the class covered every item on the list.

This subject covers: Resonant circuits and controlling their associated bandwidth; Diodes, Transistors, Junction Field-Effect Transistors, Operational Amplifiers; basic analog circuit design as applied to audio and radio frequency circuits.\nStudents spend the second half of the term designing and building their own projects.\n\n2.  This class is an Elective.  Students should take it to learn analog circuits and circuit design, to participate in a group design project that simulates design practices in industry, or to satisfy the MIT or the EECS Department Lab requirement; to work with expert analog engineers from local analog companies.\nSeveral graduate students have taken this course to get background for research work.\n\n3.  Students who want to learn analog circuits and who like hands-on lab work should take 6.101.  Also, those who would like to work closely with the instructor and local analog engineers from industry on design projects. \n\nA student needs to understand the basic principles of electronic circuit analysis well, i. e. 6.002 or equivalent.\n\n4.  My teaching philosophy is to minimize mathematical transfer functions and solutions and to emphasize visual and intuitive circuit understanding; to create a practical and useful design experience.  In the process, students will learn to understand and use a wide variety of analog circuits.  They will learn how to use books, periodicals, and websites to find circuit ideas and to supplement their textbook knowledge.  Additionally, 6.101 is supported during the project phase by engineers from local analog companies.  These engineers come to MIT to help students with their projects in person, as well as providing assistance via phone and e-mail.\n\n5.  Collaboration, etc.:  The six laboratory exercises are individual efforts.  Parts of each lab are changed each term.  Problem sets are individual efforts.  The projects are group projects [teams of 3] but each person contributing to the project is graded individually.\n\n6.  The WWW:  staff limitations have made it difficult to make the large volume of materials for 6.101 available on the web. I would rather see the TA spend time in lab helping students than spend time preparing class materials to post on the web.  However, the web is used extensively to get device specifications from semiconductor manufacturers, to find circuit design ideas, and to order parts for projects.  \n\n7.  The following companies are now supporting 6.101:  Analog Devices Inc., The Bose Corporation, Linear Technology Corporation, Intersil, and Silicon Labs.\n\t\n	Most students really enjoyed this class, and learned quite a lot about analog circuits, while gaining a lot of analog  design experience and circuit intuition. First half of the course constitued of labs exploring various electronic devices and their uses, and covering topics from AM receivers and transmitters through to audio amplifiers. The second half was given over project work, and extensive collaboration with industry professionals from a wide variety of companies. 	Ron Roscoe\nStaff\nDesign Engineers\nFinal Project	Labs in first half of term\nQuizzes	Most students took this class to gain design experience in analog circuitry and electronics, and build cool final projects 	Students felt the problem sets were easy to the point of being unhelpful.\n	Most students found that the labs were really useful for learning the material, and reasonable in length. However, the labs during the first half of the semester were very long and routine and took the average student 10-12 hours per week, though they did provide experience and familiarity with component behaviors and construction and debugging techniques. This proved helpful in the final project, which virtually all students enjoyed.	Grading was generally fair, and A centered. 	Students mostly found the textbook unhelpful, but necessary for homework problems. Most of the learning came from the notes given out in lecture. 	There were two 50 minute open book midterms. Students felt the quizzes required a solid understanding of the material but at the same time were interesting and reasonable. 	Amplifiers oscillate and oscillators amplify\n6.101 is one of the classes that make Course VI hardcore. \nTake it if you plan on being an analog engineer and prepare to invest much more time in it than your typical 12-unit class.\nDon't be lazy, pay attention, do the work, and you will enjoy it a LOT more.\n	Students generally felt that staff should keep up the good work!	http://web.mit.edu/6.101/www/ 	f	f	\N	12	12	\N	\N	Students agreed that the professor did an excellent job and followed the topics clearly.

The theoretical principles were taught in lecture and then applied in the labs.  Students felt that the details of implementation were generally left out of the lectures, making the labs difficult to complete.	Writing a compiler	Poorly written quizzes\nLack of guidance from staff\nLong and difficult labs	Most students took the class because they were highly interested in learning how to implement a compiler and did not recommend the class to anyone without a strong interest in compilers and their optimization.	There were no psets in this class, but there were collaborative mini-quizzes in every lecture.	Students greatly enjoyed the term-long project of writing their own compiler and felt that it really solidified their understanding of the material.  However, they also felt that while the labs started out reasonably, the length of the labs escalated over the term and became unreasonable by the last two labs.  Students also felt that there was not enough guidance on how to use the theoretical ideas from lecture in actual applications.	Students felt that the grading policy was unbalanced, and many disliked the fact that a large portion of the grade was based on performance relative to other groups in the final derby.  One student suggested having the grades decrease logarithmically compared to the best performer in the derby rather than linearly.	There was no required textbook.  However, students found the recommended optional textbooks to be extremely useful and learned most of the material from those resources.  Class notes, which students found helpful, were only occasionally posted online.	Most students found the first exam to be fair and reasonable.  However, they all felt that the second and third quizzes were far too long, poorly written, and contained ambiguously worded questions.	You build a compiler. A real one. All of it. From the ground up. Seriously.\n\nCompilers are hard. They're also really amazingly cool.	Students wished the class provided more details regarding implementations in addition to the theory.

Lectures and laboratory experiments explore a modern communications system including modeling transmission systems in the time and frequency domains, analog and digital signaling and circuits, detecting and correcting errors, an intro to information theory, and the engineering of packet-switched networks.   Students get a chance to sample the topics and activities in many different areas of EECS, which may help in making the choice between 6-1, 6-2, and 6-3.\n\nThe course is organized as a sequence of week-long modules, each module is covered by 2 lectures and a hands-on lab.  You and a partner work on the labs during a 3-hour lab section where there's plenty of staff to help with questions.  We use Matlab and Python in the lab but there's time to learn these as you go.   We do expect some familiarity with Fourier Series from 18.03.\n\n	Subject covers different layers of communication, successively building more and more abstractions, beginning from the details of transmission (digital abstraction, error detection/correction, compression) all the way up to the network level. There was emphasis on breadth over depth, but students felt that the subject material was very interesting and there was a good balance between application and theory.  	Labs\nLecture\nTAs	New class...\nNo textbook or readable notes\nNo practice exams.\nPoor lecture slides.	Students took this class because it is an intro class to course VI and because it's a core requirement.  	Problem sets were fairly straightforward and short. They really helped students to understand the material and tested their knowledge well. Also students found that collaborating and going to office hours was very helpful.	The class consisted of weekly labs. Students really enjoyed the labs and felt that they really reinforced the knowledge from lecture, and  helped them understand the material better while clearing any misconceptions. The time taken to complete the labs varied greatly. Some students would finish labs in 45 minutes while others would finish them in well over the 3 hours allotted, because they got stuck on some bug.	Grading was distributed between post-lab interviews exams/quizzes and homework. While the students felt that the grading itself seemed fair, some were concerned about not having access to their exit-interview scores.	There was no textbook. Class notes consisted of lecture slides which were often useful for problems sets and were available online. 	There were several miniquizzes and two exams. Students felt that the exams were generally fair, and adequately tested the subject material. Because 6.02 is a new class, students did not have many past exams to study from beforehand, and it was therefore difficult to prepare for the exams. \n\n	Wave by Wave, Bit by Bit, Packet by Packet.\n\nVertical slice through networked communication systems	Many students suggested that the staff provide more practice problems for the exams.

No Labs.	Problem sets were worth 55% of the grade and the rest came from three quizzes.  A few students complained about the lack of clear standards for scoring problem sets, noting that similar work recieved different grades from different TAs.  Overall, the grading policy was considered to be fair.	There was no textbook for this class, but most students did not seem to mind.  Ample resources for learning Python were available on the internet.  Lecture notes were incomplete and only helpful to students who had gone to class.	6.00 had three open-note quizzes, which covered the more theoretical aspects of lectures and had little overlap with problem sets.  This frustrated some students, who were not sure how to study for them.  Many students also wished that there had been more opportunities for partial credit.

The lack of depth of individual topics led some students to feel that the class was a waste of time because these topics would later be relearned in much greater detail in other classes in Course VI. However, most students felt this depth was appropriate and gave a good feel for what Course VI is all about. There was an excellent balance between theory and practice in 6.01 because material covered in lecture was almost immediately used in lab shortly thereafter. However, some students commented that the labs were often unclear and disorganized. Many students enjoyed seeing the applications of all the theoretical material covered in lecture.	Robots\nTeaching staff\nLabs	Lab writeups\nBugs in provided code\nBugs in own code\nNot enough LAs\n\n	Students took 6.01 because it is a requirement in the new Course VI syllabus. It helped a few students decide whether or not to continue pursuing Course VI. However, some other students were quite frustrated with 6.01 because it felt like the class to take if one was unsure whether or not one was interested in majoring in Course VI, whereas those students had already decided on Course VI.  	The problem sets for 6.01 consists of the online tutor problems, which were helpful in learning concepts and didn't take long to do. Most of the work for the class was buried in the labs and the lab writeups.	The labs were a big part of understanding the material in 6.01. Labs for the most part were pretty fun, but a number of them were too long, leading to a fair amount of frustration. Furthermore, there were several bugs in the provided software since the class is still quite new. Also, many students commented that the lab writeups took too long to do.	Most found the grading fair. However, many disliked the five point system. A single mistake in a long writeup could cause an entire point to be knocked off, depending on the grader. The one point knockoff essentially turns an A into a B, leading several students to believe that it was almost impossible to get an A in 6.01. However, other students thought that everyone could get an A if they wanted to - one simply has to be really meticulous when writing solutions.	There was no textbook for 6.01. The class notes were helpful, clear, complete and concise, but a few found them either average or incomplete. 	Quizzes were given each week, and reflected the material covered in that week. These nanoquizzes were easy if one had attended lecture that week, and were helpful in reinforcing the material as it was taught. A couple of students would have preferred to have traditional quizzes after lab writeups were turned in, and found the frequency of the nanoquizzes a bit annoying.	Prof White was just God-like in the lab... he could debug circuits by just looking at them!\n\n[Prof Lozano Perez] makes good attempts at jokes.	Many students suggest for the writeup lengths to be reduced in some way. The grading policy should also be made clearer in the beginning of the semester. Some students were unhappy with lab partners that did not have as much experience with programming, and advocated for 6.00 to become a prereq for 6.01. Several students thought that letting students write more of their own code, as opposed to editing existing code, would be a good idea. Also, many students would like the glitches in the labs to be fixed. One student suggested that the class be divided into chunks, with quizzes at the end of each chunk, because that student believes that the ideas will flow better and will help students learn the material more.	http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.01/fall07/	f	t	core	12	6	\N	\N	A big majority of the students said that the objectives were met.

The many important and interesting applications and methods discussed in 6.013 also help consolidate prior EECS learning.  Examples include wireless communications, antennas, circuits in the frequency and time domains, microwave systems, optical communications, MEMS, motors and generators, power transmission, and acoustics.  The subject mixes theory, physical intuition, and applications.  The ability to apply the fundamental equations to new problems was a key objective.  Grades are based on two quizzes (40%), the final exam (40%), the best 9 of 11 homework sets (15%), and tutorials (5%).  The listed prerequisite 6.003 implies 8.01, 8.02, 18.01, 18.02, and 6.002, all of which are used to some degree.  The additional prerequisite of 6.007 will be added in 2009 when any residual overlap with 6.007 will be largely eliminated.  Tutorials where students could work on homework with TA assistance were popular with many.	6.013 covered a huge range of E&amp;M applications. There was a significant physics component to this class, but the math and derivations were balanced well with real world applications. Some students would have liked more intuition and hands on experience for the material, as opposed to the high emphasis on formulas and calculation.	Cool TAs\nCool demos\nInteresting and relevant applications	Boring and sometimes convoluted lectures\nComplicated equations with little intuition	Students took 6.013 because it is a header for Course VI, and also out of interest in  E&amp;M.	Problem sets were fair, although difficult at times. Tutorials and office hours were helpful in finishing them because they did not follow directly from lectures. While they were useful in learning the material, they were often full of typos and solutions were illegible.	There were no labs for 6.013.	The grading policy was fair.

Topics include representing systems as differential and difference equations, block diagrams, system functions, frequency responses, impulse responses, transforms, and pole and zeros. Topics also include Fourier representations, and their use in modeling sampling and modulation. This is a required subject. 6.003 provides background that is necessary for many applications of EECS, including communications, control, and signal processing. The techniques are widely used in research and industry. 6.003 is useful for any student interested in applications of engineering. The most important prerequisites are 18.03 and 8.02. At the end of the course, students should understand how to use 6.003 in practical problems of the type they will encounter in research and/or industry. We encourage students to DISCUSS the homework with other students and with the staff. However, we expect that the student did all work submitted under the student's name. Students should NOT use others' solutions to prepare their solutions. Students should NOT take credit for computer code or plots generated by others.	The class is a basic introduction to signal processing in LTI systems in both temporal and frequency spaces. 6.003 covers discrete and continuous time signals and systems, their construction and analysis. The course covers both theoretical and applicative concepts but sometimes presents application before theory. Students learned about using Fourier, Laplace, and Z transforms. Many students felt that the textbook readings could have been integrated better, and the class was too heavily mathematically oriented.

Students recommended the class to anyone interested in signal and systems related topics such as signal processing,  communications, and feedback systems. 	There were weekly problem sets, divided into three sections &quot;easy&quot;, &quot;medium&quot;, and &quot;hard&quot;. Many students felt that the problems sets were often too lengthy and generally challenging, though they sometimes involved a lot of grungy math. In addition students felt that they were useful for learning the material and practicing for the exams. Most students also found that collaborating and working during office hours with TA help was extremely helpful. 	No labs.	Students were assigned grades based on two quizzes (40%), a final examination (40%), and problem sets, labs, and instructor feedback (20%). Grading was generaly considered very fair, but As were high on the grading curve for tests due to the distribution, and staff was generally stingy with partial credit. 	The required textbook was the second edition of &quot;Signals and Systems&quot; by Oppenheim, Willsky and Nawab. In addition, the second edition of &quot;Computer Explorations in Signals and Systems Using MATLAB&quot; by Buck, Daniel and Singer was required for the MATLAB labs. Most students did not refer to the textbook for the first half of the course but the recitation and lecture notes were generally well written conprehensive and entertaining and served as the textbook replacement at least for the first half of the course.\n	There were two quizzes and final. Quizzes were generally found to be more difficult than problems sets and very tricky. They  tested mathemaical intuition, as well as conceptual understanding  of the subject material. Many students thought the first quiz was tricky and unfair because it was composed of five 20 point multiple choice questions not amenable to partial credit. However, most students agreed that the second quiz was more fair and a good test of understanding. 	It seems the only thing that would guarantee a good score was a high IQ	Students had varied suggestiosn regarding the course. Some students suggested it would be more useful if the subject was organized the same way the textbook was starting with linearity, time-invariance, convolutions, then going on to transofrms. Also a few students suggested focusing even more on application  and life examples since they're fun and interesting.

This class covers the content of the previous 6.170 course, as well as much of 6.001, but with new topics and a greater emphasis on project work. The aim of the class is to teach some of the big conceptual ideas of software engineering in the context of very practical projects. Students work individually and in pairs. What we hope students take away is an appreciation for simplicity, clarity and abstraction; an understanding that software doesn't become good by tinkering but by design; and that testing and analysis are an integral part of programming.  The class will undoubtedly evolve over the next term or so as we strive to improve it. 	6.005 covered concepts in software design and implementation. It focused in large part on design patterns that facilitate modularity and abstraction in programming, with specific focuses on concurrency, state machines, and network programming.  There was also an emphasis on principles for structuring and testing code to approach large and complex problems.\n\nStudents felt that there was a good balance of theory and application, with the concepts being taught in class and implemented in projects.\n\nWhile 6.042 is listed as a prerequisite, students did not find it necessary.	Stimulating projects\nDaniel Jackson\nRob Miller	Time commitment\nQuizzes	Anyone interested in future work with software or in-depth exposure to software design should take this class.  Additionally, 6.005 can be substituted for 6.170 by students in the old curriculum.	The problem sets consisted of lecture exercises meant to reinforce new concepts.  These assignments were not time consuming, taking about 30 minutes, and were only worth a small part of the grade.	Labs were used mainly as a stepping stone to completing projects, which comprise the most of the grade in this class.  Students felt that while the labs were useful for gaining familiarity with the libraries used in the projects, the main focus was on the project itself.\n\nStudents found the projects very interesting and fun to do, although very time consuming as well.  Some noted that people without much programming experience may struggle to complete them.	Most of the grade came from six equally weighted projects, with the rest of the grade coming from quizzes.  Students felt that the grading was fair overall, but also felt that project grading was &quot;a little bit of a black box.&quot;  Some recommended implementing only the minimum set of elements required by the rubric but doing a very thorough job of documenting in order to get a good grade.	There was no textbook for the class.  The lecturers made lecture slides and lecture notes available.  The lecture notes were helpful but most students felt they needed to be more detailed and could not stand alone without the verbal component of the lecture.	Students felt that quizzes tended to &amp;quot;cover the nitty gritties of the lectures.&amp;quot;  While the quizzes did test understanding of important principles, they also tested for the class's particular definition of terms.  Additionally, students felt the quiz questions tended to be confusing and ambiguous about what they were asking for.  Because this was the first time 6.005 was offered, future versions will most likely have such issues worked out.	6.005 really takes you from cowboy-coding to writing quality, scalable, reusable and testable software.	All of the projects were done with partners, and some students suggested that including individual projects in addition to team projects would be nice.

Since students have varying degrees of past experiences in these areas, and because we present and build upon basic material, we recognize that some students may find parts of the course frustrating, and, on occasion, seemingly patronizing. However, no matter the experience level, there is always room to improve. This is an unusual class in that the course's objective is to provide guidance and feedback as students complete the various assignments (rather than to teach a specific body of technical knowledge). Students get out of the class what they put into these assignmentes, and we invite them to 1) take the initiative to create custom value for themselves, 2) use the materials, exercises and assignments to experiment, 3) improve their abilities in these important skills, and 4) develop their own personal style. We hope that students take the time to use 6.UAT as an opportunity to experiment and hone their skills -- an activity better done now, in a supportive environment with little consequence, as opposed to later, when mistakes can be professionally costly. The course is continually evolving, and we welcome input and suggestions for improvement. Finally, although not required, it is helpful if students have a thesis project or potential project topic in mind when starting the class.

The goal for the students is to design a machine that will be able to navigate its way around the playing surface, recognize other opponents, and manipulate game objects. 6.270 robots are totally autonomous, so once a round begins, there is no human intervention.   The goal of 6.270 is to teach students about robotic design by giving them the hardware, software, and information they need to design, build, and debug their own robot. The subject includes concepts and applications that are related to various MIT classes, though there are no formal prerequisites for 6.270. We've found that people can learn everything they need to know by working with each other, being introduced to some material in class, and most of all by hacking on their robots.

It emphasizes design, but also covers problem analysis and implementation. The style of the course is principled but pragmatic: students learn fundamental design concepts and patterns in the context of realistic systems. Through projects, students become familiar with standard development tools (such as Eclipse, JUnit, and Subversion) and gain exposure to a wide array of technologies, including networking, databases, concurrency, and GUIs. The course assumes a basic proficiency in programming. \n\nThe key concepts that we hope students take away are: that upfront design pays dividends, and provides a constructive step to code, using standard patterns; that decoupling is the essence of code design; and that adherence to well-defined paradigms makes programs more robust and easier to understand.\n	Students learned different kinds of design patterns and tools commonly used in software engineering through series of projects. With Java as the main programming language, this course expected students to be fluent in programming in general. Many students also commented about the amount of time they spent on the class but praised its content as being practical.	Jackson's lectures\nCool projects\nLearning software engineering concepts\n	Lab notebooks\nTime spent on labs\nAmarasinghe's lectures\nRandom partners	Most students took this class for 6-3 department lab requirement, partly because 6.170 (the legendary software engineering lab class) was suddenly discontinued. Other students took the class to gain more skills in practical software development.	There were no formal problem sets to be completed over the term. The lab notebook, lecture exercises and feedback were equivalent to problem sets. The vast majority of the class thought of the notebooks as annoying, time-consuming and not helpful in their learning.	There were six extensive design projects in the class, along with labs that complemented the project. Students regarded projects as challenging and very time-consuming but praised them as being worthwhile and very helpful in making them understand the theory behind the class. Irresponsible randomized partners for the projects were, however, a constant source of frustration.	It was divided into 50% design project, 24% quizzes, and the rest for labs and lab notebook exercises.\n\nGrading for design projects and lab notebooks varied between TAs and LAs. Students found the grading to be subjective and heavily delayed. Some also demanded for more transparency in the process.	There was no required textbook for the class. Students used lecture notes for both preparing for tests and reviewing the material. However, some commented that the material could have explained more clearly. Another recommended reference was the online Java documentation.	There were three quizzes in multiple-choice and true/false format. Most of the tested material was theory-based and had little to do with the various design projects. Opinions varied on whether the tests were fair or not. Some students regarded the quizzes as overly tricky and requiring a lot of effort to interpret the questions; other students thought the quizzes were fair but challenging. Many, however, disliked the multiple-choice format.	"If you think you like programming, and you like to make software that works efficiently, and you wanna learn cool design patterns and develop abstract design abilities, with a deep understanding of data structures and dependencies then this class is for you."	Various suggestions include giving more time for projects, concentrating more on theoretical concepts, getting more TAs to decrease their workload, and, as the majority suggest, getting rid of lab notebooks and randomized partner selection.	http://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/6/sp08/6.005/	f	f	core	12	12	\N	\N	The opinion widely splits on whether the lecturers give students clear objectives.

Since students have varying degrees of past experiences in these areas, and because we present and build upon basic material, we recognize that some students may find parts of the course obvious, frustrating, and, on occasion, seemingly patronizing. However, no matter the experience level, there is always room for improvement. This is an unusual class in that the course's objective is to provide guidance and feedback as students complete the various assignments (rather than to teach a specific body of technical knowledge). Students get out of the class what they put into these assignments, and we invite them to 1) take the initiative to create custom value for themselves, 2) use the materials, exercises and assignments to try new things, 3) improve their abilities in these important skills, and 4) develop their own personal style. We hope that students take the time to use 6.UAT as an opportunity to experiment and hone their skills -- an activity better done now, in a supportive environment with little consequence, as opposed to later, when mistakes can be professionally costly. The course is continually evolving, and we welcome input and suggestions for improvement. Finally, although not required, it is helpful if students have a thesis project or potential project topic in mind when starting the class.

The course is targeted towards EECS students with little experience in, but a serious passion for, entrepreneurship as a possible career path.  The goal of this course is to teach the &quot;engineering of business&quot;, namely the issues that entrepreneurs should be aware of, and the process by which an idea is transformed and grown into a company.   Students form teams around an idea for a product/service, and examine various non-technical aspects of a company, including talking to the customer, looking at the competition, understanding IP, thinking about financing, dealing with incorporation and stock, etc.   The building of a prototype is not required and is not the focus of this course.  If this course is taught again, the goals would remain the same, but the execution would be improved.  At the end of the course, students should be equipped with a better understanding of the steps needed to create a business, and a larger network into the entrepreneurial community.

The lectures, problem sets and laboratories prepare students for the design and implementation of a final project of their choice: games, music, digital filters, wireless communications, video, or graphics. The students make extensive use of Verilog for describing and implementing digital logic designs on a state-of-the-art FPGA. The students engage in extensive written and oral communication exercises.\n\n Students work on the final projects in teams. Discussions of problem sets and laboratories but each student must turn in their own work.	6.111 provided a lab-based follow-up class to 6.004, with more advanced material about the design and implementation of digital systems. Topics included flip-flops, different types of registers, FSMs, RAM interfacing, and video control. Students learned a lot of the nitty gritty engineering details involved with digital systems, including clock synchronization problems, glitchy logic, slow logic, and the usefulness of pipelining.	Gim Hom (lab instructor)\nLabs\nFinal project	Lectures\nDebugging\nTime-consuming labs	Students took 6.111 to fulfill the Institute Lab and/or CI-M requirements, but also because it had been highly recommended to them and they wanted to gain real-world experience implementing complex digital systems. Most students were very satisfied with their experiences in the class.	There were only a few problem sets, which somewhat helped reinforce the material taught in lecture. Some students found them more helpful than others, and some didn't really see the point of even having problem sets in the class.	Students enjoyed the labs very much and found them to be good preparation for the final project. The labs started off relatively easy and more structured and became increasingly more difficult and open-ended at a good pace. Debugging was the most challenging part of the labs, but without the experience gained doing this, most students agree that the final project would have been difficult or impossible.	Students agreed that the grading was fair, though some found that the emphasis on the CI writing staff's grading was too high, given how arbitrary and not useful that component of the grade was.	There was no textbook for the class, but some students reviewed 6.004 material out of textbooks. Students found class notes to be useful when debugging and thinking about the labs and the project.	There was one midterm, which most students found to be a good test of the class concepts. It was similar to the problem sets and most students agreed that it was straightforward, though a few found it challenging, especially compared to quizzes from previous terms.		Students generally wanted to see improvement in the lectures, and one student suggested that the lecturers not use slides.

Labs\nCool topics in computer graphics\nFinal project	Math\nReading papers	Students took the class out of their interest in computer graphics or because they enjoyed 6.837. This class also fulfills a TQE requirement.	The problem sets integrated well with the material in the class and was helpful in learning material and getting hands-on experience in algorithms.	The projects were the primary focus of the class and were very difficult. Students wanted more guidelines/hints to help doing the problem sets and suggested that a deep understanding of the material was required.	The grading policy was fair for many students.	Readings were mainly the papers suggested by the staff. In general, they were hard but also useful in completing assignments.	There was a final exam. At the time that students completed the feedback, they had not done the final yet, so no information about the final exam is available.		Students wanted more concrete examples that explained implementation of the material. Also, since this class was supposed to be a project-based class and had not had final exams in the previous terms, students were also frustrated with the idea of having a final exam in the semester.	http://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/6/sp08/6.839/	f	f	AIA	12	0	\N	\N	The objective was clear and the lectures followed the schedule well.

Prof. Berwick\nUnderstanding challenge of language manipulation in computers\nMaterial of the class	Big picture hard to understand\nTime-consuming labs\nReading and responses about them\nDisorganized lecture and material\nUnreliable instruction for assignments	The motivations for students to take the class were mainly their interest in natural language understanding in computers and computational linguistics, and their related research interest. Others took the class to fulfill requirements.	There were four Reading and Responses assignments which required a few pages of writing each about the assigned reading. The initial plan would have included five assignments but the professor canceled the last one. Students had differing opinions about how they liked the assigned readings but many pointed out that they covered interesting topics but were time-consuming.	There were two labs in the classes which were useful for learning the material. However, students felt that the labs were time-consuming and that there should have been more of them.	The grading was viewed in general as fair but some students were still clueless of how the grading in the class worked.	There were no official textbooks. Instead, there were class notes and assigned readings. However, students felt that the notes were not very well-organized.	There were no exams or quizzes in the class.

It is useful to pre-meds, and gives a lot of experience understanding and dissecting body systems. 	Problem sets were extremely helpful since no problems were covered during lecture.  However, the problem sets sometimes covered material which hadn't been covered in lecture.  Office hours and/or past problem sets (from OCW) were a must.	Labs were, quite possibly, the best part of the class. Labs were sometimes difficult to fit in because the required in-lab time was so long.  Pre-labs sometimes were on material that had not yet been covered, and occasionally did not adequately prepare students for the lab. 	The professor graded the class on a flat distribution, and only a certain number of students in the class can ever get an A.  Some students thought that the grading was somewhat arbitrary.	The textbook for the course was concise and well written.  The course reader was at times too dense and was overly in-depth compared with what was required for the course.  The lecture notes were well written and helpful.	Exams were challenging, but at the same time fairly written and similar to the problem sets.  Some students felt that occasionally a few points would be lost on aspects that would require a very thorough understanding, deeper than possible with the exposure / available time to study.

There was one relatively short final project.  Students generally enjoyed it, but some thought it was slightly too open ended and would have preferred a clearer grading scheme.  Some students disliked that it was due at the end of Thanksgiving break.	Overall, students felt the grading was fair.  Some students felt that exams were weighted too heavily compared to the time-consuming problem sets.  The final project, although not worth very much, was not announced until partway through the class.	Class notes were generally useful, but had some typos.  Sometimes the class notes differed from the material covered in class.  Some students found the notes too dense and theoretical, and some students wished there had been more explanations and examples to help them understand the material.  	The exams were very long.

Systems that employ embedded micro-control are all around you: CD and MP3 players, kitchen appliances like microwave ovens, cellular phones, calculators, television sets, and high performance aircraft, to name a few.  In ways you may not realize, even very familiar consumer products that existed in some form before the microprocessor benefit in their contemporary incarnations from microcontrollers.  A modern, high-end luxury automobile will typically contain more than a dozen microcontrollers to provide everything from engine and emissions control to music programming.  This class is your passport into the world of people who love to build elegant, efficient systems that work.\n\nCourse topics include optical tomography, multi-axis robot arm control, video and audio signal processing, power electronics including laptop power supplies and fluorescent lamp ballasts, and numeric computation (calculators and floating point calculations). This class is not particularly about learning how a specific microcontroller is programmed, or about designing circuits, or about wiring chips together.  We do a little of all of these things, but our real goal is to introduce you to a palette of tools and techniques that let you build what you can imagine.  These techniques are much more general than the details of a single processor or programming language.  Chips come and go, but successful approaches for engineering design have a life that spans many iterations of a particular technology.  \n\nStudents build a PIC microcontroller development system. You can keep this system and your course multimeter if you complete the class.\n	Students learned how to build systems using microcontrollers and a variety of other components.

The subject focused on the theory and algorithms used in nonlinear, convex optimization, with particular emphasis on unconstrained optimization methods and the theory of duality. Several students griped that no algorithms for solving constrained nonlinear optimization problems were introduced in the class, though a lot of theory was developed about them. The course seemed to focus more heavily on theory rather than application.	Laid-back nature of the class\nLectures, especially guest lectures\nFinal project instead of final exam	Grading was disorganized\nProject presentations\nNot applied enough	Students took this course mostly out of interest in learning about nonlinear convex optimization, and they recommended it to anyone else with similar interests.	Students generally agreed that the problem sets were useful for learning the material, though sometimes they required (or could be easily solved by) concepts that were not covered in class. Partnerships for each problem set were assigned by the TA, and the problem set had to be handed in with the partner. This either helped or made things harder, depending on who the partner was. Some students completed the assignment independently in any case.	There were no labs, though there was a final group project in the class. One student complained that the final project presentations consisted of the groups trying to demonstrate technical proficiency rather than teach concepts. However, other students appreciated the final project as an opportunity to explore a topic of their choice. Students had mixed feelings about the requirement that it be a group project.	Students found the grading to be fair.	The readings consisted of class notes and two recommended textbooks. Students found the book by Bertsekas to be very good and relevant to the problem sets, since problems were mostly drawn from there. However, the book was very dense and needed to be read all the way through for things to make sense. The other book, by Boyd, was less useful. Many students found the class notes problematic, due to typos and omissions.	The only exam was a midterm, which students found to be reasonable.		Students generally wanted more focus on algorithms for constrained optimization, rather than theorems and lots of results for the unconstrained case. One student also asked for more coordination between homework problems and the material covered in class.		f	f	CCS	12	0	\N	\N	The course objectives were clearly outlined, and though the lecturer fell behind slightly, the course still satisfied them for the most part.

We cover deterministic and stochastic signal processing, image processing, and statistical inference. This elective is of interest to students who want opportunities for hands-on application of signal processing techniques and experience with real-world biomedical problems. Students should take this course to prepare for work in an academic or commercial environment where they will need to analyze biomedical signals and/or medical images. Our goal is to give students a toolbox and the knowledge of when to use each tool so that they have skills to approach new problems/applications with signal processing techniques appropriate to their current problem/application. Lectures provide theoretical material and background on physiological and medical systems, as well as real-world examples from guest lecturers working in the field. Labs are done with partners but written up independently. Partners may share figures, Matlab code, and ideas but not the text of lab reports. Group work is okay for homework problem sets. 6.003 or equivalent is required as a prerequisite. Familiarity with probability and statistics is helpful. The class can be taken before or after 6.011/6.341 as it gives practical aspects of some theoretical topics covered in those courses.	6.555 covered the fundamentals of signal processing, image processing, probability and statistics as relevant in signal processing, as well as EKG signal processing in time and frequency domains, speech processing, blind source separation (separating maternal and fetal EKGs), medical image registration and segmentation.  	Labs\nProfessor Greenberg\nWorking with real-life medical data\nNo final\n	Long lab reports\nDebugging MATLAB\nProbability section\n9:30 lecture	Students took this course because they were interested in the material or they needed to satisfy requirements.	The problem sets were fairly straightforward and good preparation for the quizzes.  They were also indicative of what material was going to be on the exams, and they were useful for getting practice with the concepts.	Labs were very interesting and gave students ideas on how the material could be applied in various medical imaging procedures.  There were labs every other week, and everything was done in MATLAB.	About half the class was supposed to get As and the grading seemed fair, though some of the grading on the labs seemed subjective.	Class notes, which were available for the first half of the semester, were very clear and useful.  	Quizzes did a good job testing the material from the problem sets.  The quiz syllabus handouts were very specific, and understanding the concepts from the labs and the problem sets was critical for success.

It is not designed for students with advanced knowledge of any programming language. The course is primarily designed for students who are taking 6.01 in the spring, but have not programmed much before, as 6.01 assumes some background in programming from day 1. \n\nThe course is taught bootcamp style, with daily lectures and problem sets done in a lab, with numerous LAs to help (a ratio of about 8 students per LA). Working with friends is encouraged, but assignments must be ultimately completed by the individual student. A final project at the end of the course is done in groups of two.\n\nIdeally, we hope students in 6.189 have grasped the basics of programming, and are overall more comfortable looking through code files. We don't expect that a six-unit IAP class can fully teach the intricacies of programming; however we hope to improve basic understanding and reach a level of comfort with coding such that 6.01 is fun, rather than frustrating or imposing.

The homeworks and project involve parallel programming on real multicore systems. Topics include:\n\nIntroduction to key multicore applications in scientific computing, signal processing, embedded networking and digital video and audio; Parallel computing models including shared memory, streams, and messaging; Parallel programming techniques; VLSI technology and multicore constraints; Communications and interconnection networks; Multicore caching and memory systems, shared memory and cache coherence, messaging and streaming; Multicore processor design and synchronization; and performance evaluation methodologies.\n\nThe course comprises lectures, readings, homeworks, and a substantial project.\n\nWhy should students take this particular elective?\n\nParallel computing has become a hot area for research and development. Our computing industry has recently made a  disruptive shift from sequential computers to multicores in virtually every domain including scientific and desktop computers, laptops, cellphones, TVs, home media servers, web and networking systems, gaming machines, and automobiles. By covering the software and hardware foundations of parallel computing, this course will prepare you for research, teaching, or cutting edge industrial development in software, hardware or applications. \n\nThis class is particularly applicable to research since the area of parallel computing -- particularly  involving hundreds or thousands of processor cores --  is a hot research area, rich with open problems in multicore operating systems, architecture, compilers, programming languages, databases, and applications.\n\nWho should take this course?\n\nStudents with a diverse set of backgrounds from virtually any engineering discipline can take this course. Prerequisites include an undergraduate course in computer architecture (e.g., MIT's 6.004). \n\nWhat is the collaboration policy?\n\nStudents are strongly encouraged to collaborate on assignments. The final project is accomplished by teams of two to four students. However, the writeups and presentations should be prepared individually.\n\nIf students keep one or two concepts from this subject, what do you hope they would be?\n\nThink parallel. \n\nWhat is your teaching philosophy for this subject?\n\nI try to de-emphasize grades, and try to encourage students to have fun, focus on learning cool new stuff, and be creative.	This class taught parallel computing and the practical issues concerning it, both from a hardware and software perspective: message passing, shared memory, channel communication schemes, network architecture, memory and cache coherency.

It is designed for first year undergraduate students. In the first half of the term, students perform laboratory exercises designed to introduce (1) the design, manufacture, and use of microfluidic channels, (2) techniques for sorting and manipulating cells and biomolecules, and (3) making quantitative measurements using optical detection and fluorescent labeling. In the second half of the term, students work in small groups to design and test a microfluidic device to solve a real-world problem of their choosing. Includes exercises in written and oral communication and team building.\n\nStudents meet for three hour sessions on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Each session focuses on a topic -- beginning with an informal lecture/discussion during the first hour, which introduces the hands-on activity for the remaining two hours.\n\nHomework during the first half of the term will consist of weekly reading assignments and short (700-1000 words plus figures) written laboratory reports. Homework during the second half of the term will be associated with the individual projects, and will include writing a project proposal as well as preparing drafts and final project reports.	6.07 was a freshman-oriented lab class, providing freshmen with exposure to lab and research skills pertaining to microfluidics.  It integrated material from several different areas, such as physics and biology, teaching both theory and applications.  The class size was ideal for working in small groups, especially on the final project, which involved designing and testing a microfluidic device to solve real-world problems.  	Hands-on lab experience\nOpen-ended final project\nSubject material (microfluidics)	Long discussions\nInsufficient time for final project\nLack of structured reading assignments	Most students wanted to gain lab experience during their freshman year.  It was also a good opportunity to explore a multidisciplinary field and gain exposure to areas such as biology, chemistry, and electrical engineering.  The class also fulfilled a CI requirement, and because it was 9 units, it fit well into many students' schedules.  	The writing assignments were generally considered to be simple and useful in solidifying project ideas.  Collaboration was natural because of the group-oriented nature of the projects.  Some students felt that some of the assignments could have been returned with more comments.  	The lab projects were the main component of the class, and they were generally considered to be fun and interesting.  Students enjoyed the autonomy that they had in designing their final project.  Some felt that having more structure would have shown them what was realistic to accomplish in the time frame that they had.  	Students were generally unclear about what the grading policy was.  The grading for individual assignments was fair.  	There was no textbook.  The notes and readings on the material and on writing lab reports were very helpful.  	None.	"Great, fun, chill intro freshman lab class. I like how we get to jump right into lab projects."\n\n"It gave me some hope that in choosing my major now, I won't really be all that limited in what I actually end up doing."	Many students suggested having less discussion and devoting more time to experimenting, especially for the final project.  Other suggestions included making practice presentations more structured and having the advisers give less contradictory advice about the projects.  		f	f	none	9	0	\N	\N	The objectives were generally considered to be clear and met.

The class was taught in the TEAL format; students were required to watch video lectures and finish textbook readings prior to attending class and spent class time problem solving in groups.

There were no labs in this course. 	The exact grade cutoffs were not clear, but students were told that the grade distribution would be B centered, and they could view their approximate class ranking online. Although grading was generally regarded as fair, some students felt that the grading for participation was unfair because scores varied depending on each TAs expectations.  	The course had assigned readings from the class textbook, which was available online for free.  Students felt that the textbook was useful and easy to understand.  There were daily preparation checks which tested whether students had done the assigned reading.  Class notes were also posted online, and students found them to be informative.  	There were two midterms and a final exam, and students were allowed to bring a crib sheet to each exam.  Exams were generally regarded as difficult, but fair.  Some students thought that the grading was too strict and that points were deducted for technicalities rather than lack of understanding.  \r\n\r\nThe course also included weekly mini-quizzes, which made sure that students kept up with the material. 	"Tedious daily assignments, quick pace, daily quizzes"\r\n"The online videos and free textbook are superb."

It was meant to be more contemporary in subject matter than 6.045, but a little less mathematically demanding than 6.840 (the two established courses to which it's most similar).  It fulfills a general distribution requirement.\n\nTopics covered included: algorithms in the ancient world; a smattering of logic, circuits, and finite automata; the work of Cantor, Gödel, and Turing; P, NP, and NP-completeness; probabilistic computation; cryptography, pseudorandomness and one-way functions; interactive protocols and zero-knowledge proofs; computational learning theory; quantum computing and the physical limits of computation.  (Written lecture notes are available on the Stellar website.)\n\nThe students ranged from freshman to masters.  The basic prerequisite is mathematical maturity, as could be gained (for example) by 6.042 or 6.046.\n\nOverall, I'm happy with how the course went; I hope the students got as much out of it as I did.  As one would expect, not everything worked perfectly the first time around, and I've learned valuable lessons which I intend to apply next time.  One is to complement the course's historical and philosophical focus with a stronger focus on applications, especially in areas like cryptography.  A second is to assume a bit less in the way of mathematical background, and to work one-on-one with students to make sure they understand what's expected when asked to prove things on problem sets and exams.  A third is to leave more time for informal discussion, which to me was one of the highlights of the course.\n\n(Two other differences: the course will probably be larger the next time it's taught, and there will be no scribe notes requirement.)	6.089 covered a large range of topics from the field of theoretical computer science, such as logic, finite automata, Turing machines, complexity theory, and quantum theory.	Professor Aaronson's jokes\nQuantum computing	TAs were difficult to reach\nToo many acronyms\nAssumed large amount of background material\nProblem sets harder than class lectures	Students took this subject to fulfill requirements and learn more about theoretical computer science.	Problem sets were correlated with the material covered in class and were helpful in covering the material.  The problem sets were interesting but somewhat difficult and going to office hours was essential to clarifying the problems.	None.	Grading was evenly distributed between problem sets, scribe notes, the midterm, and the final.  Grading seemed a bit subjective, as in most theoretical courses.  	Class notes came from student-written scribe notes. Sometimes they were posted late, which made them not very useful.	The quizzes were fair and based on problem sets but were also somewhat difficult.

The techniques include divide-and-conquer reasoning, discretization, dimensional analysis, special cases, proportional reasoning, and symmetry.  The applications come from the physical and biological sciences, mathematics, and engineering.  Particular examples include bird and airplane flight (how far can birds and 747's fly?), musical acoustics (how are pianos tuned?), how fog droplets fall, the computing power of the brain, program debugging, and animal jump heights. \n\nThis subject is designed to develop your intuition and to help you reach reasonable answers even when you feel lost.  Those skills help in solving problems in other technical subjects at MIT.  Those skills are also useful for research, which is the art of getting lost in interesting places, and finding your way out to tell the tale. \n\nAs a prerequisite, it is helpful to be familiar with physics concepts such as power, energy, and force; and it is helpful to not be afraid of programming (though no programming experience is needed).  By design, the subject avoids complex mathematics; we analyze the world using just algebra and geometry. \n\nThe subject is organized into eight units, with each unit discussing one reasoning technique such as dimensional analysis or special-cases reasoning.  Each unit incorporates examples from across science, engineering, and mathematics, with a few everyday and economics examples as well.  Seeing the wide applicability of each technique helps in learning the technique. \n\nIn each lecture, I ask the class several conceptual questions to discuss and argue about in small groups (peer instruction). Students vote for their favorite answers, and we discuss the alternatives collectively.  The small-group and whole-class discussions introduce you to your fellow students, help you pinpoint what is confusing, and give me feedback on how well I am explaining the ideas. \n\nThe class gets its fair turnabout.  At the end of each lecture, I ask the class to fill out anonymous one-minute cards on what was confusing and what was interesting.  I try to answer all questions at the start of the next lecture, and use the feedback in planning the topics and demonstrations for upcoming lectures. \n\nOn the homework assignments, students are encouraged to work in groups.  They are encouraged to not look up intermediate values or answers for the estimation questions until after trying the questions, whereupon comparison is encouraged. \n\nNext year there will be a textbook based on the notes from this year. By popular demand, there will also be more demonstrations!	This class was a survey course in which students learned methods and approaches for approximation and applied them to real life problems.

They were lengthy but fun and useful for learning the material. There were some usability issues with the programs used for the labs, but they did not diminish students' enthusiasm and enjoyment of the labs.	6.004 used an objective grading policy with a set number of points available for the semester. Each quiz or lab was worth a certain number of points, and each letter grade had a number of points corresponding to it. Once students obtained that many points, they were guaranteed that grade for the course, provided they completed all the required labs. Students felt this policy was very clear and fair.	There were no readings.	Quizzes drew their questions primarily from past quizzes and tutorial problems, making it easy for students to do well on them.

The second half is devoted to the basics of signal transduction in neurons, including Hodgkin-Huxley model and action potential, myelinated and unmyelinated fiber, and biophysics of ion channels.\n\nThis course is a course 6 header for bioelectrical engineering concentration.  Students need to take this course to learn the basics of cellular physiology, in order to prepare further studies in this area. As an elective this course will provide quantitative insights on basic cellular physiology, as well as an introduction to the fundamentals of neuroscience.  \n\nStudents who are interested in biomedical / biological engineering / neuroscience as their future career path should take this course. We focus/stress more on quantitative understanding of biological systems, therefore requiring certain mathematical/engineering backgrounds at the level of 18.03 or 6.002. This course is great for students who thrive in projects / experiments, which is a significant part of the course. \n\nWe spend a lot of time in the projects, where students have a chance to apply what they learn in the lectures in solving the problem they chose. This is a great way to learn the two important themes. 1) Biological systems (cells) can be understood in quantitative terms. 2) Biological systems are complicated because of multiple driving forces / factors involved. \n\nWhile students are expected to submit their own work as homeworks and exams, projects are done in pairs collaborating toward the common goal. Students in a group will receive the same overall project grades. In doing so, students will learn how to collaborate with a partner, which is an important skill but not often taught or emphasized. Use of bibles (if there is any) is discouraged since students will lose the chance to test their own understanding before the exams, which usually contains new problems.\n\nThe main improvements of future 6.521 offerings would be 1) improving the projects 2) revising the course contents in order to reflect all the new development in the field.   \n	This class did not receive sufficient comments.

The subject also focuses on computational models of certain aspects of human intelligence.\n\n6.034 is important to computer science majors because instructors in higher-level subjects, employers, and graduate schools all have come to expect computer science majors to understand the basic problem solving and learning ideas developed through Artificial Intelligence research.\n\n6.034 should be taken in any case by students interest in any of the subareas of Artificial Intelligence. Because the material in 6.034 is foundational, 6.034 is a prerequisite for most advanced subjects in AI, including subjects specialized to vision, learning, language, expert systems, medical systems, robotics, and understanding human intelligence from a computational point of view. Many AI-oriented faculty members also consider 6.034 as important background for undertaking UROP projects.\n\n6.034 should be taken not only by computer science majors, but also by anyone interested in understanding their own intelligence from a computational point of view.\n\nOne key element of the teaching philosophy is that the subject should teach not only skills but also big-picture ideas. Another key element of the teaching philosophy is that AI's powerful ideas not only enable you to build smarter computer systems, they also enable you to be smarter yourself.\n\nStudents are encouraged to talk about the assignments and to use as much supporting material as they can find; to equalize opportunity, quizzes from the recent past are distributed to everyone.\n\nThe 6.034 staff will continue to experiment with the material and with the division of function between tutorials, recitations, and lectures. Suggestions for both evolutionary and revolutionary changes are welcome.\n\nSee http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.034f/index.html for additional details. 	6.034 teaches students about many fundamental artificial intelligence concepts, such as search, game logic, and machine learning. Lectures focused on the history, philosophy, and theory of artificial intelligence, while recitations and tutorials focused on applications and implementations.

The final exam, which was held in class, was more fair, but students were also burdened with the final project, which was due less than a week before. Students recommend reviewing old quizzes, since the quiz questions tend to differ in style from the problem set questions.

Topics include mathematical formulations; network problems; sparse direct and iterative matrix solution techniques; Newton methods for nonlinear problems; discretization methods for ordinary, time-periodic and partial differential equations, methods for partial differential and integral equations, techniques for dynamical system model reduction.\n\nCourse philosophy: emphasis is on 'learning by doing' rather than on theory. Students learn how to solve practical large problems. The problem sets lead them through the development of their own circuit, thermal and mechanical simulators. \nThe problem sets will require lots of programming (mostly in Matlab).\n\nCollaboration policy: collaboration is highly encouraged, however each student must write his/her own code and problem set report independently.\n\nGrading policy: the class grade is mainly based on the problem sets. The class is not 'curved', i.e. everybody could potentially get an A if ALL problem sets are completed in a satisfactory way, showing effort and understanding.	6.336 gives a good survey of numerical methods applied to various problems including linear systems, nonlinear systems/root-finding, PDEs, and ODEs. Both traditional/common methods (LU factorization, Newton's method, finite-difference/-element) and more advanced methods (GCR, Spectral Methods) are covered.

The class had two labs. Students could opt to take 6.169 which included more labs. The class was taught at a fair pace, but many students felt it was too theoretical and could incorporate more hands-on learning.

Some felt that it was easy to make algebraic mistakes and would find more quiz-type questions on problem sets helpful. There were problem sets due during weeks with tests or labs due.	Most students felt that the labs were cool and helped reinforce what was learned in class. However, they felt that the administration of the labs was disorganized: there were too few TAs, overcrowded spaces, a lot of students with questions and broken equipments. Some students felt that the labs were long and recommend starting early to avoid overcrowding.	Most students feel grading was fair. Some feel that it was hard to receive partial credit on exams. Psets were graded from 1-3 which some students liked while others didn't.	Students had mixed opinions: some felt that the textbook was useful in providing examples and clarifying concepts while others mainly reviewed lecture notes which were clear and concise. Students pointed out that lecture notes were not uploaded online so they must attend lecture if they wanted the notes. 	Most students felt exams were long and difficult, but fair. Most felt exam questions were similar to questions on psets. A few pointed out that it was useful to include appropriate equations on crib sheets to avoid rederiving them during the exam.

The subject is particularly suitable for students in different academic departments that are contemplating carrying out research in various areas of microelectronics: technology, device physics, circuit design. The subject is also of value for students who are interested in working with semiconductors in a broad range of applications. \n\nThis subject emphasizes physical understanding and building a solid set of models for electrostatics and carrier transport in semiconductors that apply in many physical situations. Nevertheless, there is emphasis on modern devices, especially the scaled MOSFET for logic applications. \n\nThis courses uses many learning styles: classical problem solving homework, as well as design problems and device characterization exercises. The subject also uses a set of notes that covers in detail most of the topics.  	6.720 teaches the fundamentals of operation of microelectronic devices from the carrier transport level. Topics include energy band diagrams, MOSFETs, pn diodes, Schottky diodes, and CMOS and BJT physics and modeling.	Professor del Alamo	Time consuming	Students took this course because they were interested in the material, because they needed it for their TQE, or because it was related to their research. Students should take this class if they are interested in transistor or device behavior.	The problem sets were difficult and time-consuming, but they were necessary to understand the material. Collaboration was very helpful.	Labs were reasonable, but they started rather early when some of the relevant material hadn't been covered yet. The design project was programming-intensive and interesting, and it really exposed students to the design choices and challenges that face device designers today.	Grading was fair.	The not-yet-published textbook consisted of chapters given out to students in class. This textbook was thorough, easy to understand, and very useful, although there was no index. There were also lecture slides, which were concise and a good supplement to the textbook, since they focused on the key points.	The open-book quizzes were very similar to the problem sets, and they were very difficult and long, but fair. A deep understanding of the material was required to perform well.

It treats many of these topics mathematically with a strong emphasis on theory rather than application.	Material	High workload\nProblem sets	Students took this course because they needed it for their research. Students planning to do research in optics should take this course, but they are warned that this is a tremendously time-consuming course.	Problem sets are extremely difficult and time-consuming. The questions were sometimes ambiguous or seemed unrelated to the material. The problem sets were useful for learning the material, but they were also frustrating. Students took turns grading the problem sets, and they also had to make one original homework problem.	There were no labs.	Grading was mostly fair. Problem set grading was done by other students, so those grades could seem arbitrary.	The textbook was useful, but it often skipped derivations, making it incomplete as a reference.

Students often collaborated to bounce ideas off each other and find the key to solving the problems.	There were no labs.	The grading policy was 20% midterm, 40% homework, 40% final. The top half of the class received an A. The grading policy was fair.	The textbook, written by Sipser himself, was very useful because lectures followed the textbook very closely. The textbook was very clear and readable.	The midterm was open-book and contained problems similar to those in the problem sets, but easier. Because most of the problems still required creative thinking and being able to see the &quot;trick&quot; to solving them, some students were tripped up by the time limit. Most students did not think the midterm was too hard.	"The lectures, book, problem sets, and exam (midterm, at least) all hung extremely well together, making it very straightforward both to get an overview of the material and to learn thoroughly. This coherent combination of learning sources, together with the professor's very friendly lecturing style, was the greatest strength of the class."	No suggestions; the class is fine as is.	http://www-math.mit.edu/~sipser/18404/18.404.html	f	f	TCS	12	0	\N	\N	The objectives were clear and followed.

Since students have varying degrees of past experiences in these areas, and because we present and build upon basic material, we recognize that some students may find parts of the course frustrating, and, on occasion, seemingly patronizing. However, no matter the experience level, there is always room to improve. This is an unusual class in that the course's objective is to provide guidance and feedback as students complete the various assignments (rather than to teach a specific body of technical knowledge). Students get out of the class what they put into these assignments, and we invite them to 1) take the initiative to create custom value for themselves, 2) use the materials, exercises and assignments to experiment, 3) improve their abilities in these important skills, and 4) develop their own personal style. We hope that students take the time to use 6.UAT as an opportunity to experiment and hone their skills -- an activity better done now, in a supportive environment with little consequence, as opposed to later, when mistakes can be professionally costly. The course is continually evolving, and we welcome input and suggestions for improvement. Finally, although not required, it is helpful if students have a thesis project or potential project topic in mind when starting the class.	6.UAT teaches students how to give effective presentations. Students try out different types of presentations (negotiation, debate, proposal, blackboard, slides) and receive feedback on how to improve.	Tony Eng\nRecitations\nPracticing presenting	Mandatory attendance	Students took this course because it was required for course 6 majors. This class is recommended for those who want practice and improvement with their presentation and public speaking skills.	There were no problem sets. Assignments were almost always presentations, and the ones that weren't presentations were usually not very useful. Students generally enjoyed the chance to practice their presentation skills.	There were no labs.	Many students thought the grading policy was fair, but a lot of them mentioned that grading seemed to be subjective. Grades were posted online.	There were no readings.

The algorithms are presented by layers, from the basic MAC communication layer up through applications such as sharing data and controlling robots. \n\nIt is a graduate elective.  It is especially appropriate for students interested in research in wireless networking, and for theoretically-inclined students interested in distributed algorithms.  It is also fine for other graduate students interested in learning about this new and important area.\n\nStudents taking the course should have basic familiarity with discrete math and sequential algorithms, and also some knowledge of how computer systems work.  A background in distributed algorithms is helpful, but not necessary.  Prior knowledge of wireless networking is not required.\n\nThe intent of the course is to help to shape a theory for wireless network algorithms, while teaching students the state of the art.\n\nMain concepts:  Wireless network algorithms are different from wired network algorithms, in terms of the capabilities and limitations of the platforms on which they run.   Local broadcast communication provides both advantages and disadvantages.  Algorithms can/should use geographical information.  Algorithms may interact with the real world.\n\nCollaboration is encouraged.  We prefer no bible use.\n\nNext time, we will change the emphasis on different topics a bit, e.g., adding more on robot and vehicle control.\n	This class did not receive sufficient comments.

There were seven modules in the class: Divide and Conquer, Data Structures, Optimization, Network Flow, Linear Programming, Intractability (and dealing with it) and Advanced Topics. 	In 6.046, students learn about algorithm design, analysis, and theory.	Material\nTextbook	Long problem sets\nExams	Students took this course because they were interested in algorithms or needed the course to satisfy requirements. This class is recommended to students who are interested in algorithms, but they are advised to have prior algorithm experience (e.g. 6.006) before taking 6.046.	There were seven problem sets. They were long and difficult, but useful for learning the material. Students often collaborated to bounce ideas off each other.	There were no labs.	Grades consisted of 18% homework, 23% for each quiz, and 36% for the final. Additionally, missing homework would cause one's grades to drop at an exponential rate. Most students thought grading was fair.	The textbook (CLRS) was very useful, detailed, and complete. Lecture notes were also helpful.	There were two exams: one 2-hour evening exam and one take-home exam. The first exam had questions that were easier than the problem set questions, so its difficulty was reasonable. The take-home exam required a lot of time and was much more difficult. A thorough understanding of the material was crucial for both exams. Doing the problem sets was also very helpful in preparing for the exams.	"I had to collaborate with someone else on all of the problem sets because I don't think either of us could have done them alone. They were often very time consuming."	Students had various suggestions, including adding supplementary material to the website, separating problem set and quiz dates by a week, and holding more office hours.	http://theory.lcs.mit.edu/classes/6.046/	t	f	TCS	12	0	\N	\N	The objectives were clear and met.

Students study topics such as design philosophies, memory management, environments, processes and context switching, file systems, networking, web servers, and driver development. In the first half of the course, students learn how an operating system works by studying two simple operating systems. The second half of the course has students reading papers to learn more about the theoretical aspects of operating systems. There was a good balance of theory and application, because students applied what they learned by building their own operating system.	Labs	Debugging\nExams\nTime consuming	Students took this course because they were interested in operating systems. 6.828 is recommended to students who are interested in operating systems and have lots of times. Future students are advised to take the class with friends, complete labs on time, and make sure they have enough time to devote to this course.	Homework assignments entailed doing the required readings and answering questions or doing a short write-up. Some students found the homework to be useful, but many thought the assignments were tedious, useless, and only designed to make sure students did the readings.	Labs were the best part of 6.828. They were very time consuming, but they were interesting and really helped students grasp the concepts taught in this course.	Students were confused about how the grading policy worked, because there was no feedback on homework and students generally got full points on labs. Grades were also dependent on participation, which further confused students. Still, most students felt assured that the grading was fair.	There was no textbook. Class notes were mediocre and often asked questions without answering them. Students also read many papers.	The midterm was long and difficult, and it seemed somewhat out of place in this course, since its questions emphasized material from papers and lecture rather than labs. The exam required a thorough understanding of the material in order to do well.	"The subject is awesome.

"We got two tries at each quiz, once in class, and once at home, with the final grade the average of the two. I liked that, because it forced me to figure out what I did wrong the first time around."	Suggestions included focusing more on general concepts than the details and trying to build intuition.		f	f	DCS	12	0	\N	\N	The objectives were clear and met.

It served as a great follow-up to 6.170 or 6.005 and was a good introduction to building scalable and fast computer systems. This special laboratory subject will be offered as 6.172 in future semesters.	Amarasinghe, Rinard, Leiserson\nProjects\nGuest lectures\n\n	Sharing cagnode machines before the project deadline\nNot all assignments were well designed/balanced	Students took this course because they were were interested in performance and parallel programming.

Grades were based on who had the fastest code, so collaboration wasn't helpful.	Labs were very interesting and taught students a lot of new material. The labs were interesting and directed at solving real world problems. The projects were overall fun and extremely rewarding. 	The grading policy was a bit vague as some students didn't think that the grade distribution was clear. Some thought the grading policy should be revised. Grading projects were broken down into categories including performance, correctness, style, and methodology. Students weren't allowed to collaborate outside the group because the labs were graded competitively. They were graded on what percentage of the maximum possible speed they were able to get, but students suggested a logarithmic scale would have been better.	There was no textbook, only course notes in the form of lecture slides. Students thought a textbook or lecture notes with more explanations would have been helpful.	There were mixed feelings about the quizzes. Some thought they were well-written while others thought the questions were obviously newly written because they were vague or the sample code had bugs. The first quiz involved reading and understanding a lot of C Code, while the second quiz was straightforward and covered material from lecture. 	"Good class for awesome code hacking. Competitive grading keeps the work exciting."\n"The best C/C++ lab at MIT."	Some students felt that the class tried to balance between being an intro class (and going over the basics) or an advanced class (that spent time on interesting things they couldn't learn anywhere else). Hence, they felt that they would have liked to see more depth with the advanced topics. They would have liked more projects (such as coding a memory allocator from the ground up) and learning about how other students made performance enhancements. As for other details, they suggested more collaboration, conveying expectations clearer, and handing back assignments back more quickly.  		f	f	CSA	12	12	\N	\N	The objectives were broad, but the class in general followed them well.

To exploit the potential contributions of improvements in our understanding of genomics, proteomics and the “new biology,” we must combine such data with the clinical data that represent the patient’s phenotype. We must also develop new analytical methods to find the important relationships among these data, and then apply them in many settings to improve health care.\n\nThese needs form an intriguing engineering challenge described in this class, along with methods and practices aimed at their solution.\n\nWhy take it?  Who?\n\nTo learn about biomedical computing, from an integrative viewpoint.  The class is required for students in the HST Biomedical Informatics master's program (who already have MD's), and an elective for others, mostly engineering students.  The class relies on skills and experience from programming, AI, and modeling from previous courses.\n\nPhilosophy:\n\nWe try to provide an insightful introduction to how modern medicine is practiced and how that practice is supported by computing. We focus on medical records, data organization and coding, communication, and clinical data use in research. We present the evolving state of the art in combining such data with high-throughput measurement techniques that are uncovering the bases of disease at the molecular biology level.\n\nAbout 1/3 of the lectures are given by guest lecturers, who are at the leading edge of research and development in relevant areas such as privacy protection, public health, medical enterprise computing, healthcare IT for the developing world, and personal healthcare systems.\n\nCollaboration:\n\nStudents are encouraged to collaborate, but homework assignments are to be written up and turned in individually. Term projects are supposed to be done by small teams, often combining students with MD and engineering backgrounds.\n\nFuture changes:\n\nWe are working on a set of course notes to better integrate material now taught from a text and many papers. Because biomedical computing evolves rapidly, the class will also, but not necessarily in predictable ways.\n\n	The subject is a great survey course for biomedical informatics, but lacks in-depth technical analysis of any of the topics.	Professor Szolovits\nGuest lecturers	None	Students took this course to satisfy graduate-level requirements or because they plan to get into the field of biomedical informatics.	Some students found the problem sets useful; others found them useless. They were time-consuming for everyone.	The final open-ended design project was very reasonable and offered a great way to apply some of the topics that students learned in the class.	The grading policy was unclear.	The textbook was a good resource. It was a collection of stand-alone essays.	N/A		Introduce the final project initially, and repeatedly. Encourage group formation earlier. It can get a little cliquey (some people know each other, other stragglers have to scramble). Consider assignments of groups. Allow more time for a really great final project.

Computer architecture\ncontinues to be a dynamic and rapidly evolving field. We emphasize the\nbroad array of factors that influence architecture including\ntechnology, applications, and software systems.  We describe a wide\nrange of architectural mechanisms and show how they arose given the\ndesign constraints at the time, and how old ideas can become\nattractive again as technology changes. Our goal is to help you\nunderstand not just the &amp;quot;what&amp;quot; but also the &amp;quot;why&amp;quot;; and the &amp;quot;why not&amp;quot; behind the various mechanisms to prepare you for future developments.\n\nThe class is aimed at all systems students, not just those planning to\nspecialize in computer architecture.  In particular, the class\nprovides essential background for those wishing to write software that\nperforms well on modern systems.  This class is primarily geared\ntowards graduate students and seniors, and is often used by doctoral\nstudents to satisfy a TQE requirement. Students should have some\nundergraduate knowledge of computer architecture (6.004) and a\nrudimentary knowledge of basic logic design. Some undergraduate-level\nknowledge of operating systems and compilers can be helpful as well.\n\nTopics may include: instruction set design; processor\nmicro-architecture and pipelining; cache and virtual memory\norganizations; protection and sharing; I/O and interrupts; in-order\nand out-of-order superscalar architectures; VLIW machines; vector\nsupercomputers; multithreaded architectures; processor reliablity; memory models and synchronization; chip multiprocessors\nand parallel computers.  Students interested in implementing these\nideas are encouraged to take 6.375 Complex Digital Systems, offered in\nthe Spring.\n	In 6.823, students learn about advanced computer architecture concepts such as pipelining, branch prediction, caching, and consistency.

The problem sets were optional and very long (~30 pages). They were also boring and sometimes the problems or solutions were out-of-date.	Labs were very interesting and well-designed. They involved a lot of programming and took time, but they were reasonable in length.	Grading was fair.	The textbook was useless.

This subject covers: Resonant circuits and control of the associated bandwidth; Diodes, Transistors, Junction Field-Effect Transistors, Operational Amplifiers; basic analog circuit design as applied to audio and radio frequency circuits.\nStudents spend the second half of the term designing and building their own projects.\n\nThis course satisfies both the EECS Dept. and the Institute Lab requirements.\n\n2.  This class is an Elective.  Students should take it to learn analog circuits and circuit design, to participate in a group design project that simulates design practices in industry, or to satisfy the MIT or the EECS Department Lab requirement; to work with expert analog engineers from local analog companies.\nSeveral graduate students have taken this course to get background for research work.\n\n3.  Students who want to learn analog circuits and who like hands-on lab work should take 6.101.  Also, those who would like to work closely with the instructor and local analog engineers from industry on design projects. Many students from courses 2, 8, 16, 18, 22 find this course useful.\n\nA student needs to understand the basic principles of electronic circuit analysis well, i. e. 6.002 or equivalent such as 6.071.\n\n4.  My teaching philosophy is to minimize mathematical transfer functions and solutions and to emphasize visual and intuitive circuit understanding; to create a practical and useful design experience.  In the process, students will learn to understand and use a wide variety of analog circuits.  They will learn how to use books, periodicals, and websites to find circuit ideas and to supplement their textbook knowledge.  Additionally, 6.101 is supported during the project phase by engineers from local analog companies.  These engineers come to MIT to help students with their projects in person, as well as providing assistance via phone and e-mail.\n\n5.  Collaboration, etc.:  The six laboratory exercises are individual efforts.  Parts of each lab are changed each term.  Problem sets are individual efforts.  The projects are group projects [teams of 3] but each person contributing to the project is graded individually.\n\n6.  The WWW:  staff limitations have made it difficult to make the large volume of materials for 6.101 available on the web. Thi past term I had no TA but with the help of a former TA, Eric Grebing, I was able to post the labs, psets, lecture notes, etc, on Stellar. Also, the web is used extensively to get device specifications from semiconductor manufacturers, to find circuit design ideas, and to order parts for projects.  \n\n7.  The following companies are now supporting 6.101:  Analog Devices Inc., The Bose Corporation, Linear Technology Corporation, Intersil, and Silicon Labs.	The class taught all about analog circuits, RF circuits, diodes, op-amps, transistors/fets. The labs provided a good balance between theory and application.  The class built practical ability and intuition.	Labs\nfinal project\nRon Roscoe	Hours spent in lab\nFinal paper &amp; presentation\nHaving lab, pset, quiz in the same week.

Students who received less than a C in either of those courses do not have adequate preparation for 6.011. Parts of 6.011 can tend to look a lot like 6.003 and 6.041 revisited and to some extent are. However in revisiting and extending that material the student is now exposed to and held responsible for increased sophistication and depth of understanding that goes well beyond mechanical manipulation of the equations.  The lectures on state-space models require that students be comfortable with basic matrix manipulations and eigenvalue/eigenvector properties covered in 18.03 (and further developed in 18.06).  Regarding homework and collaboration, each student is asked at the beginning of the semester to choose between one of two options for the homework. In one option, homework is not handed in and is not graded (and of course not weighted in the final grade). With the second option, homework is handed in, graded, and weighted in the final grading. Collaboration on homework is permitted and encouraged, but students must list the collaborators on the homework.	Takes 6.003 a step further and shows you how communication systems work.

Many students said that the material is very interesting, and that they've learned a lot of very useful and practical information.\n	Interesting and cool material\nThe professors\nLearning about real world computer systems	Lots of reading\nHard design projects and writing\nLectures can be boring	Most students took the class because it is required for 6-3 majors, and it's a CI-M and header. Some students took it simply out of interest.	&quot;Hands-on&quot; assignments were generally easy. Most students felt that they helped them better understand the material, though some felt the assignments were not helpful.	The design projects were generally very challenging and took up a lot of time. They also entailed a lot of writing. However, many students felt that these assignments were worthwhile in learning the material. The open-endedness of the design problems allowed for some creativity.	Students generally had mixed feelings about the grading. Some felt that the grading was fair, while others thought that the grading for tests was somewhat unfair due to the T/F questions. Some felt that certain writing sections were graded more harshly than others.	Many students thought that the class notes were too verbose and detailed, and that they weren't practical to read. There were also assigned readings that were at times long and difficult to understand, but many students found these quite practical and very interesting. Overall, there is a LOT of reading for this class!	Most students felt that the quizzes were very challenging and tricky. Some felt that they did not test understanding very well, but others felt they were reasonable as long as you kept up with readings and lectures. The quizzes were mainly multiple-choice and open note/book.	What makes this class exciting is the content. It goes over lots of important concepts of system design that I feel every EECS major has to know.	Most students felt that there was too much weekly reading, and think there should have been less. Some students also felt that lectures and recitations should be better connected.		t	f	\N	12	4	\N	\N	Feelings were very mixed. Some felt that the objectives were clearly defined and well met, while others felt that the objectives were vague, and that they did not get a clear picture of what they were supposed to be learning; had trouble finding a grand underlying theme.

Since students have varying degrees of past experiences in these areas, and because we present and build upon basic material, we recognize that some students may find parts of the course obvious, frustrating, and, on occasion, seemingly patronizing. However, no matter the experience level, there is always room for improvement. This is an unusual class in that the course's objective is to provide guidance and feedback as students complete the various assignments (rather than to teach a specific body of technical knowledge). Students get out of the class what they put into these assignments, and we invite them to 1) take the initiative to create custom value for themselves, 2) use the materials, exercises and assignments to try new things, 3) improve their abilities in these important skills, and 4) develop their own personal style. We hope that students take the time to use 6.UAT as an opportunity to experiment and hone their skills -- an activity better done now, in a supportive environment with little consequence, as opposed to later, when mistakes can be professionally costly. The course is continually evolving, and we welcome input and suggestions for improvement. Finally, although not required, it is helpful if students have a thesis project or potential project topic in mind when starting the class.	The class's goal was to teach students how to communicate successfully verbally and give good presentation. During the course of the class students gave several presentations.

The techniques include divide-and-conquer reasoning, discretization, dimensional analysis, special cases, proportional reasoning, and symmetry.  The applications come from the physical and biological sciences, mathematics, and engineering.  Particular examples include bird and airplane flight (how far can birds and 747's fly?), musical acoustics (how are pianos tuned?), how fog droplets fall, the computing power of the brain, program debugging, and animal jump heights. \n\nThis subject is designed to develop your intuition and to help you reach reasonable answers even when you feel lost.  Those skills help in solving problems in other technical subjects at MIT.  Those skills are also useful for research, which is the art of getting lost in interesting places, and finding your way out to tell the tale. \n\nAs a prerequisite, it is helpful to be familiar with physics concepts such as power, energy, and force; and it is helpful to not be afraid of programming (though no programming experience is needed).  By design, the subject avoids complex mathematics; we analyze the world using just algebra and geometry. \n\nThe subject is organized into eight units, with each unit discussing one reasoning technique such as dimensional analysis or special-cases reasoning.  Each unit incorporates examples from across science, engineering, and mathematics, with a few everyday and economics examples as well.  Seeing the wide applicability of each technique helps in learning the technique. \n\nIn each lecture, I ask the class several conceptual questions to discuss and argue about in small groups (&amp;amp;quot;peer instruction&amp;amp;quot;). Students vote for their favorite answers, and we discuss the alternatives collectively.  The small-group and whole-class discussions introduce you to your fellow students, help you pinpoint what is confusing, and give me feedback on how well I am explaining the ideas. \n\nThe class alsogets its turn.  At the end of each lecture, I ask the class to fill out anonymous one-minute cards on what was confusing and what was interesting.  I try to answer all questions at the start of the next lecture, and use the feedback in planning the topics and demonstrations for upcoming lectures. \n\nOn the homework assignments, students are encouraged to work in groups.  They are encouraged to not look up intermediate values or answers for the estimation questions until after trying the questions, whereupon comparison is encouraged. \n	This class taught how to solve problems by approximation and make better back-of-the-envelope calculations.	Sanjoy\nPsets	none\n\n	Students thought 6.055 would be really interesting and useful for any engineer. Many had also heard good things about the course and the professor.	The problem sets were a good review of concepts introduced in lecture. They were not very difficult and graded on a P/D/F scale.	N/A	The grading policy was very lenient. It was based on the four P/D/F psets.	The online class notes were excellent and were a useful reference when working on problem sets.	No quizzes	One of the most useful classes you might take at MIT. I would like to see it as a GIR.\n\nThe whole course is designed to teach us how to think, and it successfully teaches concepts and principles that we can apply regardless of where we are in life.\n\nSanjoy - he is the ultimate ninja.

Systems that employ embedded micro-control are all around you: CD and MP3 players, kitchen appliances like microwave ovens, cellular phones, calculators, television sets, and high performance aircraft, to name a few.  In ways you may not realize, even very familiar consumer products that existed in some form before the microprocessor benefit in their contemporary incarnations from microcontrollers.  A modern, high-end luxury automobile will typically contain more than a dozen microcontrollers to provide everything from engine and emissions control to music programming.  This class is your passport into the world of people who love to build elegant, efficient systems that work.\n\nCourse topics include optical tomography, multi-axis robot arm control, video and audio signal processing, power electronics including laptop power supplies and fluorescent lamp ballasts, and numeric computation (calculators and floating point calculations). This class is not particularly about learning how a specific microcontroller is programmed, or about designing circuits, or about wiring chips together.  We do a little of all of these things, but our real goal is to introduce you to a palette of tools and techniques that let you build what you can imagine.  These techniques are much more general than the details of a single processor or programming language.  Chips come and go, but successful approaches for engineering design have a life that spans many iterations of a particular technology.  \n\nStudents build a PIC/2051 microcontroller development system. You can keep this system and your course multimeter if you complete the class.\n	This class teaches you how to design and build systems with microcontrollers. You spend lots of time wiring together chips and writing assembly to make neat devices (such as a functional robot arm).  This class was very heavily biased towards application.  You learn how to build systems that involve microcontrollers. You don't just learn assembly or circuits, but the basics of microcontroller design applicable to almost any microcontroller project.  Many students noted how this class unified most concepts in Course VI.

Prof. Leeb was known by many of the students before the class to be a great professor as well.  This class also fulfilled CI-M and lab requirements.  	There were no problem sets.	The labs were the heart of the course.  There were 5 labs and one final project.  The final project was a free-style project which allowed students to choose any topic they want.	There was an absolute grading policy with a strict cut-off for a particular letter grade.  	There was no text book; the class notes/lecture notes were very useful.\nThe Scherz book is an excellent book for any electronics hobbyist; one would want to keep it even after the class.	The one exam was a little tricky, but by all means fair for what had been taught in lecture and lab.\n	you pick up a vast amount of general EE knowledge that every engineer should know.\n\nLabs were terribly long and exhausting and sometimes demoralizing but I learned a lot and despite all the pain, it was worth it.\n\n[Prof. Leeb] is a religious experience that's not to be missed. \n\nHe is a truly unique educator among the professors at MIT.\n	Curve the quiz.\n\nlabs should migrate towards writing in C instead of assembly.\n\nDo not schedule the longest lab right before spring break (which is also generally mid-term week).

It is important to realize the time commitment necessary for the lab portion of the class, as well as the creation of the various lab reports. This class should not be taken with a heavy course load. The class hopes to give the students basic understanding of the many tools used in fabrication so that they can build structures on their own.

The first half covers fundamentals of photography and electronic flashes, including experiments on application of electronic flash to photography, stroboscopy, motion analysis, and high-speed videography. During this period, students write four extensive lab reports. In the second half, students work in small groups to select, design, and execute independent projects in measurement or photography that apply the learned techniques. \n\nIf you wish to improve your communication skills, if you wish to learn how to work effectively in a laboratory, or if you want to learn how to capture and investigate events that are too swift to be seen, then you will find the subject interesting. All of these (particularly the first two) are of great help if you will be conducting academic or applied research. Those who are interested in the subject matter should take the class. Those who want an easy lab should not. \n\nIf you only keep two concepts from the class, I hope that first would be that project planning will make your life easier and that you can create amazing things with your hands by paying attention to what you are doing and working with care. The philosophy of 6.163 was set by the late Prof. Harold Edgerton -- Work hard, tell everyone everything you know, close a deal with a handshake, and have fun!

The course is organized into two parts.  The first part covers nonlinear effects in wave propagation and EM wave theory which is applied to the design of nonlinear optical devices; the second part covers the quantum theory of nonlinear interaction of light and matter.  \n\nAmong the topics covered are wave propagation in anisotropic media, electro-optic modulators, harmonic, sum and difference frequency generation, parametric oscillators, nonlinearities in optical fibers, solitons, and the nonlinear interaction of light and matter, perturbation theory, density matrix theory, laser gain, laser operation and spectroscopy. \n\nThe course is intended for students who are performing research in optics, spectroscopy, photonics, optical devices, and optical communication systems.  The objective of the course is to give students the necessary foundation for performing independent research in these areas.  \n\nThe course text consists of notes on nonlinear optics written by Prof. E.P. Ippen.  There are also recommended texts and class handouts.  \n\nThe course requirements consist of 6 problems sets, one quiz and a term paper.  Problem sets are assigned every two weeks.  (Please note that the time spent per problem set should therefore be divided by two in order to calculate the time spent per week on homework).  \n\nThe term paper is chosen by the students on a topic of their choice related to their research or independent interest and is an opportunity to learn more detail about a specific topic.  \n\nEach member of the class was also required to participate in grading one of the problem sets and to create one problem and its solution on material covered in class.  The purpose of this was to make students more familiar with the material from different perspectives and also to enable full grading of the sets which would not be possible otherwise.  Students are not required to do the problem set for which they are grading.  Therefore, only 5 problem sets are actually required for the course.  \n	6.634 is taught in two sections: the first half of the class emphasizes classical E&amp;M, with emphasis on real-life problems; the second half is much more theoretical content. The course is very comprehensive, and some studentes felt that some topics were skimmed over quickly.

These areas are illustrated using examples from diverse fields of science and engineering. \n\nThe assignments include readings, viewing lectures on OpenCourseWare, reflecting on the readings, and constructing homework problems. Collaboration is encouraged. \n\nI believe that learning occurs most readily through formulating and reflecting on questions.  So, questions are welcomed during lecture and on the (anonymous) feedback sheets turned in at the end of each lecture.  I answer those questions at the start of the next lecture, and hope thereby to encourage the students to do the same in their own teaching. \n	This class taught students about the concepts underlying teaching and learning.  Some topics included: how to design problems, how to structure a course, and how to lecture at the board.

It emphasizes design, but also covers problem analysis and implementation. The style of the course is principled but pragmatic: students learn fundamental design concepts and patterns in the context of realistic systems. Through projects, students become familiar with standard development tools (such as Eclipse, JUnit, and Subversion) and gain exposure to a wide array of technologies, including networking, databases, concurrency, and GUIs. The course assumes a basic proficiency in programming. The key concepts that we hope students take away are: that upfront design pays dividends, and provides a constructive step to code, using standard patterns; that decoupling is the essence of code design; and that adherence to well-defined paradigms makes programs more robust and easier to understand. \n	This class taught good design paradigms for programming and software development and engineering. It made the students better and more efficient programmers.	Devadas\nProjects, especially the chat client GUI	Numerous all-nighters\nLack of course notes\nBeing in a bad group\nInconsistent TAs	Most students took the class because it was a requirement for the new 6-3 or to fulfill the lab requirement.  Many took it to learn how to program well in group settings.  The class material was very applicable and directly marketable.	The three problem sets consisted of both theoretical questions on material covered in class as well as applications to the implementation of some small programs.  Most noted that they were excessive in length, at times extremely tedious and vague.  	Labs and design projects helped the students learn, and the projects were reasonable in length.They were fairly open ended to allow students some freedom when designing, but still manageable.\n	The grading was very subjective, and varied greatly from TA to TA.  Very similar work could receive very different points. The grading of projects was very slow, taking over a month to get the project grades back.  Students were left in the darkness about their current standing no matter how well they were performing.	Most noted that the class notes were helpful but there was no textbook.

Writing an optimizing compiler from scratch\nProfessor Amarasinghe is the GOD of compilers\nThe 'compiler derby' at the end	Lots of work - massive group project!	Most students took this class because they were interested in programming languages and compilers. It was also an AUS.	There were no problem sets for this class.	Students found the team-project of creating a compiler to be very difficult and time-consuming, but at the same time extremely rewarding. The students had a very thorough understanding of how compilers worked by the end of the subject.	Students generally felt that the grading was fair, though projects were weighted quite heavily.	Most students found the class notes generally good. Although there were no required textbooks, students found it useful every so often to refer to materials found in them.	Many students found the open-note exams to be on the difficult side, and they usually involved &quot;pretending to be a compiler&quot; and using the techniques discussed in class.	This was a truly inspirational, fantastic class. The class is really what MIT is all about. It was hard, fast-paced, challenging, extremely instructive and open-ended.\n\nYou build a real compiler from the ground up. That pretty much says it all.	Most students had various comments about the material in the class. Here are some comments:\n-Writing a compiler from scratch is awesome, but the &quot;from scratch&quot; part raises the barrier to entry for students. Perhaps providing more infrastructure would be helpful.\n-I know that you briefly mentioned object oriented concepts while talking about symbol tables, but I would have really liked a more thorough discussion. A big reason I took this class was to make myself a better programmer by understanding what goes on under the hood. For example, I'd like to know how classes are usually represented so that I know how much overhead I'm suffering when I use some of these object oriented features. There were one or two lectures that I didn't really understand - I think it was &quot;foundations of data flow analysis,&quot; or something like that. I think it was just talking about the things we had already learned (data flow analysis) on a more abstract level, but I'm not sure. I felt like I never managed to piece those lectures in with everything else, and I wasn't sure if I was seeing new information or old information in a new way. Also, tell us about what kind of IR our optimizations will work on before we write the IR. Namely, there are a couple requirements I can think of that we didn't know- it should be completely linearized (no explicit loops, branches, etc), it should have no tree structure (expressions should be flattened to have only two arguments) and variables should remain as abstract concepts (shouldn't be at the level of registers and memory addresses yet).\n-Some features of the decaf language seemed unnecessarily restrictive. Why only single dimensional arrays? The programs at the end all acted like they had multidimensional arrays, and it would have been easier to do parallelization with them had they been used as such. I never understood the restrictions on function ordering (no cross recursion?), ordering of variable declarations in scope, etc. Would it have been that hard to have a little dynamic memory allocation? Just call malloc behind the scenes? I'm glad we didn't have to deal with floating points though.\n-Class should not be scheduled for Monday through Thursday during a prime time slot (11am-12pm) when only half of these slots are used. It makes more sense to meet twice a week for 1-1.5 hours and distribute the lectures more evenly throughout the term.		f	f	CSA	12	8	\N	\N	Most students felt that the objectives were definitely met.

If you want to start a company, 6.976 will give you the chance to live the steps to bring that passion to fruition, with substantial exposure to mentors and leaders from the business community. You’ll learn by doing. We’ll have guest speakers who have travelled this path, successfully and unsuccessfully. Although we will cover the basics of new venture creation, this is not a class about how to write a business plan. Rather it’s about grasping the essence of the journey you’re about to undertake.

Mastery of Feedback = Mastery of Circuits. No bibles are allowed. Students are allowed to collaborate.	6.376 teaches quite a bit about analog circuits, and covers topics such as device physics, feedback, and noise. The course was also a very a good balance between theory and application - the first half of the class taught fundamental building blocks, while the second half of the class looked at interesting examples of how these were put into practice. The pace was generally fast.

What does the subject cover:\n\nThis course covers the fundamental principles of the processes used in the fabrication of devices for silicon integrated circuits, and how these processes are integrated together to form state-of-the-art Si CMOS.  The course covers both advanced physical models and practical aspects of major processes such as thermal oxidation, solid-state diffusion, ion implantation, epitaxial growth, etching, and silicides.  In particular, advanced models for diffusion (transient enhanced diffusion) and ion implantation are emphasized.  The impact of processes and process integration on device characteristics (e.g. reverse short channel effect) is also discussed.  Focus is on physical understanding, with exposure to concepts used in process modeling and simulation.  A lecture is included on strained Si CMOS and SiGe growth and processing issues.  Students are given the opportunity to use a modern process simulator in the homework assignments and in the Final Project.\n\n\n2.  Is this a required subject?\n\nThis subject is not required.  However, it is strongly recommended for anyone considering a career in or related to microelectronics/microfabrication, and for graduate students doing research in that area.  Students interested in integrated optoelectronics, microphotonics, and nanofabrication will also benefit from a thorough understanding of modern CMOS processing.\n\n3. Who should take this course, and what are the pre-requisites?\n\nThe course is geared towards graduate students, however it can be taken by advanced undergraduates as well as masters students and Ph.D. candidates.  It is helpful to have exposure 6.152J, but this is a recommendation and is not required (the text is complete enough to take care of background issues).  Students who have been exposed to basic concepts of the MOSFET (e.g. 6.012) will better appreciate the in-class examples on how processing impacts devices.\n\n4.  What is the teaching philosophy for the course? If students keep one or two concepts from this subject, what do you hope they will be?\n\nThe teaching philosophy for this subject is to combine fundamental physical background with modeling techniques as well as exposure to “practical” aspects.  The textbook by Plummer et al, does a good job of this.  In addition, material from recent conference publications is added to the lectures, to expose students to practical use of the concepts in the course.  Another part of the teaching philosophy in this subject is that students need to gain experience using modern simulation tools (such as tsuprem) in order to better understand how the models work in practice.  Homework assignments emphasize checking the results of simulations against hand calculations, where possible, to make sure that the simulations make sense.  Students are given a chance to practice their public speaking skills by doing a polished oral presentation at the end of the semester (in place of a written report).  Key concepts include: (1) the fundamentals and modeling of oxidation, diffusion, ion implantation and transient diffusion, and (2) physically-robust models (as opposed to ‘fitting’) and how they can predict complex processes and interactions among processes in a CMOS fabrication flow, as demonstrated by exercises using the tsuprem simulator.\n\n5.  What is the collaboration policy for this course?\n\nStudents learn best in this area by discussing ideas with each other.  Collaboration is allowed and encouraged.\n\n6. If you teach this subject again, will it be different?\n\nThe syllabus as well as some of the details of the material is updated each time the course is taught as the field changes rapidly. \n\n	The subject covered front-end semiconductor processing and focused primarily on silicon electronic devices.  Students learned about important transistor fabrication processes, for example, oxidation, diffusion, implantation, and growth.  They used simulator SUPREM extensively.  The content was very helpful for understanding current industry terminology and challenges. The subject was not math or physics intense, but provided very useful tools for simulation and knowledge for interpreting the results.

The problem sets were quite useful, and most students didn't use bibles.  Students used Tsuprem4 simulations a lot on the problem sets.	None.	Many students found that the grading was fair.  A few said that it was easy to lose many points on the problem sets.	All of the students said the textbook was great and exceptionally useful.  The class notes provided a good summary of the text.

Students found the material a bit theory-heavy at times, but there were always examples and applications mentioned.	Lecture notes\nProfessor Tommi Jaakola\nBreadth of material	Recitations\nLack of depth\nExams	Many students took the class because it was relevant to their research. Others took it because of an interest in machine learning. 	There were a total of five problem sets, with some of the material showing up on the tests. Students found them helpful for getting both experience with the different tools and better familiarity with derivation for many of the results proved in class. Some students liked that they only had to tweak code, while others wished for more rigor.	There was an open-ended final project. Consensus among students was that you got what you put into it. Most students found the project very fun and a good chance to apply what they had learned in class.	Students found the grading a bit lenient, with 30% based on just completing the problem sets. Some found this annoying in terms of getting proper feedback on how they were doing, while others liked it.	The course had no textbook, but students found the class notes to be very good as a reference. There were also lecture slides, which some students found very useful, while others found them useless.	Students found the exams challenging. A common complaint was that the questions only allowed a small set of anticipated answers, so you would either know the answer or not be able to find it at all.

This class is not required, but is highly recommended for anyone in an engineering or math major because Matlab is a powerful tool that will help you with homework, research, or personal projects. Everyone should take this course; although some prerequisites are listed, the course is taught in such a way that beginner programmers with no exposure to linear algebra can finish the class. The philosophy of the class is to teach as many people as much about matlab as possible in a one-week period. Hence, grading is not very strict, and any reasonable attempts to do the homework will result in a Pass. Students are allowed to collaborate on homework assignments, but each student must turn in his/her own work. Students are encouraged to spend at least 3 hours per day on homework because this is the only way you can learn how to program; by struggling with it until you start to think about it in the right way.

Students found the labs useful, but the length and difficulty of the labs varied a lot over the term.  A few students complained that there was often a long line for checkoffs.	Students generally found the grading policy to be fair, although a few thought there was an over-emphasis on lab performance.	Lecture slides were posted online, but other than that no course notes or textbook existed for most of the material taught in the class, so students who missed classes reported that they had difficulty learning the material they missed.

It emphasizes design, but also covers problem analysis and implementation. The style of the course is principled but pragmatic: students learn fundamental design concepts and patterns in the context of realistic systems. Through projects, students become familiar with standard development tools (such as Eclipse, JUnit, and Subversion) and gain exposure to a wide array of technologies, including networking, databases, concurrency, and GUIs. The course assumes a basic proficiency in programming, but doesn't assume prior knowledge of Java. \r\n\r\nThe key concepts that we hope students take away are: that upfront design pays dividends, and provides a constructive step to code, using standard patterns; that decoupling is the essence of code design; and that adherence to well-defined paradigms makes programs more robust and easier to understand.\r\n	The subject covered software design, and the importance of design before implementation.  Various programming practices and paradigms were introduced.

The problem sets were somewhat useful, but tedious and long.	The design projects were time-consuming and difficult, but rewarding.  Some students found working with their groups to be frustrating. 	Graded assignments were often returned a long time after they were turned in, and it was difficult to know how well one was doing in the class.

I would also like to complain that I didn't think it was fair that an 80 minute exam should constitute more of our grade than any of the 20-60 hour projects that this class had. It just doesn't seem fair. Also, since this semester was shorter, I think they should have taken out the in-class exam and made only one, take-home test, that was not due the same week as two other projects.

Students took this class because it is a Course 6-3 and 18-C requirement.  Also, they were interested in algorithms and had liked 6.006, the prerequisite.	Students felt that problem sets were not graded fairly, difficult, time-consuming. There was no consensu as to whether the problem sets were useful for learning the material. Collaboration is helpful.	There were no labs.	The average was generally low average on quizzes.  Problem set grades seemed random. There were complaints that it was difficult to find out their grades since problem sets were returned so late.	The textbook is useful as well as Professor Demaine's notes which were well written.	The take home quiz was extremely difficult. Regarding Quiz 1, some students thought it was easy while others thought it was difficult.	This class takes all the algorithm concepts that you learned in 6.006 and shows you how to go above and beyond in every category.\n\nErik is the coolest, friendliest professor to grace the lecture halls of MIT.\n\nErik Demaine: best. professor. ever.

It is a chance to remember why you came to MIT:  to learn and to build cool systems.  We study the design and construction of power electronic circuits and motor drives.  Laboratory exercises include the construction of drive circuit for an electric go-cart, flash strobes, computing power supplies, three-phase inverters for AC motors, and resonant drives for lamp ballasts and induction heating.  We examine basic electric machines including DC, induction, and permanent magnet motors. As a member of this class, you'll complete a sequence of assigned projects, followed by a final project of your choice, emphasizing creativity and uniqueness.\n\nThe overarching goal of this class is to share with you the skills and techniques that designers use to make useful systems that solve problems for people.  These are the skills that will make you successful in an engineering career.  They empower you to see the value of analysis techniques you have learned.   Your experience in this class will teach you to use analytical methods to constrain problems in ways that lead to winning solutions – answers that make your UROP project successful, that make your thesis work, that make your product a commercial success, that let you stand flat-footed in front of a problem and fight to win.\n\nPower electronic circuits are the backbone of almost every modern convenience.  Renewable energy sources like solar cells and windmills, automobiles, cell-phones, laptop and desktop computers, television sets, and kitchen appliances, among many other systems, require power electronics circuits to convert electrical energy to a useful form.  \n\n	In this subject student learn how to control power in electronic circuits, how to construct efficient AC/DC converters, motors and learn about feedback. It is very applicable to real world engineering if one wants to be EE.

The first half covers fundamentals of photography and electronic flashes, including experiments on application of electronic flash to photography, stroboscopy, motion analysis, and high-speed videography. During this period, students write four extensive lab reports. In the second half, students work in small groups to select, design, and execute independent projects in measurement or photography that apply the learned techniques. \n\nIf you wish to improve your communication skills, if you wish to learn how to work effectively in a laboratory, or if you want to learn how to capture and investigate events that are too swift to be seen, then you will find the subject interesting. All of these (particularly the first two) are of great help if you will be conducting academic or applied research. Those who are interested in the subject matter should take the class. Those who want an easy lab should not. \n\nIf you only keep two concepts from the class, I hope that first would be that project planning will make your life easier and that you can create amazing things with your hands by paying attention to what you are doing and working with care.

This course builds on the concepts from 6.004, going into more depth on instruction set design, pipelining, caches, virtual memory, speculation and out-of-order execution, branch prediction, advanced micro-architectural techniques, such as vectors and multi-threading, and multiprocessor-related topics, such as on-die networks, synchronization and cache coherence. Many of these topics are taught with a historical perspective to better understand how architectural solutions are influenced by a broad array of factors including technology, applications and software. We describe a wide range of architectural mechanisms and show how they arose given the design constraints at the time, and how old ideas can become attractive again as technology changes. Our goal is to help you understand not just the 'what' but also the 'why' and the 'why not' behind the various mechanisms to prepare you for future developments.\n\nThe class is aimed at all systems students, not just those planning to specialize in computer architecture.  In particular, the class provides essential background for those wishing to write software that performs well on modern systems.  This class is primarily geared towards graduate students and seniors, and is often used by doctoral students to satisfy a TQE requirement. Students should have some undergraduate knowledge of computer architecture (6.004) and a rudimentary knowledge of basic logic design. Some undergraduate-level knowledge of operating systems and compilers can be helpful as well.  \nStudents interested in a followup course to explore the implementation of the concepts from this course are encouraged to take 6.375 Complex Digital Systems, offered in the Spring.\n	This class was about modern computer architecture.  Most of the class was about existing computer systems and was good for people who were interested in low level architecture.  Some students were dissatisfied that the class was focused on labs and quizzes as opposed to projects.

Through projects, students become familiar with standard development tools (such as Eclipse, JUnit, and Subversion) and gain exposure to a wide array of technologies, including networking, databases, concurrency, and GUIs. The course assumes a basic proficiency in programming, but doesn't assume prior knowledge of Java. \n\nThe key concepts that we hope students take away are: that upfront design pays dividends, and provides a constructive step to code, using standard patterns; that decoupling is the essence of code design; and that adherence to well-defined paradigms makes programs more robust and easier to understand.\n	The lectures focus mostly on code/software design and cover both theory and application.

Students read papers on various systems and do two design projects through the term, but there is no actual implementation involved.	Reading interesting papers\nContent\nRecitations\nMadden\nLampson\n	Exams\nGrading scheme\nWriting assignments\nReading\n	Students took this course because it fulfilled the CI-M requirement or because it was required for 6-3.  Some students took it because they were interested in computer systems.\n	There were 6 problem sets and some short writing assignments in addition to weekly reading assignments. The problem sets (called Hands-Ons) were long but not difficult.  They usually involved doing something through Athena to really learn what was taught in class.  	There were two design projects which involved writing a paper and no implementation.  The design projects were long, interesting, and useful.  They made the students think about real world systems and enabled them to apply the material they learned in class.  	Students felt that the grading was subjective.  Many assignments were graded harshly and students did not know how they were doing in the course.	The textbook got mixed reviews -- some students found it useful, but others thought it was wordy and boring.  Students found the class notes useful.  Overall, though, students felt that they needed to read only the papers to do well in the course.	The tests were in multiple choice form.  They seemed obscure and there was no partial credit given.  The exams heavily tested the papers that students were supposed to have read.  Students felt that there was not enough practice during the semester for exam type questions.  Several students mentioned that they felt that they were being tricked. Students felt that the exams did not measure their understanding of the material.	Wikipedia is your friend.\nI love the subject! It's like it's all the stuff computer people know... and how to be a computer person.	Students would have liked more specific review for exam type questions.  They felt that tests were not a good judge of what they learned in the class.  Some students suggested replacing the quizzes with problem sets.  Students also requested that the lectures be less dry.	http://web.mit.edu/6.033/www/home.html	t	f	CSA	12	4	\N	\N	Students agreed that the course had clear objectives which were met.

The course is organized into two parts.  The first part covers nonlinear effects in wave propagation and EM wave theory which is applied to the design of nonlinear optical devices; the second part covers the quantum theory of nonlinear interaction of light and matter.  \n\nAmong the topics covered are wave propagation in anisotropic media, electro-optic modulators, harmonic, sum and difference frequency generation, parametric oscillators, nonlinearities in optical fibers, solitons, and the nonlinear interaction of light and matter, perturbation theory, density matrix theory, laser gain, laser operation and spectroscopy. \n\nThe course is intended for students who are performing research in optics, spectroscopy, photonics, optical devices, and optical communication systems.  The objective of the course is to give students the necessary foundation for performing independent research in these areas.  The course is intended for real world research.  \n\nThe course text consists of notes on nonlinear optics written by Prof. E.P. Ippen.  There are also recommended texts and class handouts.  \n\nThe course requirements consist of 6 problems sets, one quiz and a term paper.  Problem sets are assigned every two weeks.  (note that the time spent per problem set should therefore be divided by two in order to calculate the time spent per week on homework).  \n\nThe term paper is chosen by the students on a topic of their choice related to their research or independent interest and is an opportunity to learn more detail about a specific topic.  \n\nEach member of the class was also required to participate in grading one of the problem sets and to create one problem and its solution on material covered in class.  The purpose of this was to make students more familiar with the material from different perspectives and also to enable full grading of the sets which would not be possible otherwise.  Students are not required to do the problem set for which they are grading.  Therefore, only 5 problem sets are actually required for the course.  \n	This class taught the basics of Nonlinear Optics. It focused on theory in lectures and applications on problem sets.	Lectures\nBalance of theory and engineering	Large amount of material tested on only one exam.

We\ntry to accomplish this goal by studying digital communication systems;\nsuch systems are ubiquitous, they incorporate a wide range of ideas in\nelectrical engineering and computer science, and communication system\nproblems lead to engaging weekly design labs.  The course starts with\nissues in transmitting bits across a link, and students use signal\nprocessing to improve bit transmission, use probabilistic descriptions\nof noise to estimate bit errors, and apply techniques to detect and\ncorrect errors. The course then focuses on the problem of sharing\nlinks, and students use filtering and modulation for\nfrequency-division multiplexing (and wireless transmission), and\nthey develop protocols and contention management techniques for\ntime-division multiplexing.  The course finally focuses on networks of\nlinks, and students examine distributed routing algorithms, develop\nstrategies for reliable data transport, analyze approaches for\nmaximizing throughput, and develop algorithms for data compression. 	6.02 surveys and bridges concepts from the EE and CS side in the context of communications and networking.

Generally not very hard, they were done online, where immediate feedback and unlimited checks were available.  Several solutions could use more explanation.	The labs provided the essential practical component of this course.  The first few were longer, but the later ones seemed more reasonable and were more popular.  Generally, the labs were very helpful in understanding the material, but they not tested.  Common complaints include a frustrating environment for the IR lab and lab computers needing to be upgraded.	Grades were fair and immediately available online.  They were split 50% labs and 50% exams.	There was no textbook, which many found frustrating.  However, most found the class notes useful.

The course notes need to be online in time, and the lab checkoff system could be more efficient.

Systems that employ embedded micro-control are all around you: CD and MP3 players, kitchen appliances like microwave ovens, cellular phones, calculators, television sets, and high performance aircraft, to name a few.  In ways you may not realize, even very familiar consumer products that existed in some form before the microprocessor benefit in their contemporary incarnations from microcontrollers.  A modern, high-end luxury automobile will typically contain more than a dozen microcontrollers to provide everything from engine and emissions control to music programming.  This class is your passport into the world of people who love to build elegant, efficient systems that work.\r\n\r\nCourse topics include optical tomography, multi-axis robot arm control, video and audio signal processing, power electronics including laptop power supplies and fluorescent lamp ballasts, and numeric computation (calculators and floating point calculations). This class is not particularly about learning how a specific microcontroller is programmed, or about designing circuits, or about wiring chips together.  We do a little of all of these things, but our real goal is to introduce you to a palette of tools and techniques that let you build what you can imagine.  These techniques are much more general than the details of a single processor or programming language.  Chips come and go, but successful approaches for engineering design have a life that spans many iterations of a particular technology.  \r\n\r\nStudents build a PIC microcontroller development system. You can keep this system and your course multimeter if you complete the class.\r\n	This is an engineering class: you learn to synthesize what you have picked up in other classes into building a real working system.  Material is interesting, practical, and nearly always immediately applicable.

They take LOTS of time (you should NOT start them the night before they are due), but they are well designed and make you understand the material.  	50% labs - 20% final project - 25% quiz - 5% participation.  There were mixed reviews about the grading policy. Some found it fair, while others thought that too much weight had been put into the quiz. Some were disappointed with the quiz having no partial credit and thought that succeeding in it was just a matter of luck.	No comments.	No comments.

Very fun and animated style, keeps it interesting, and he has some absolutely amazing, mind-blowing demos.\r\n\r\n6.115 is definitely MIT's 'stereotypical' electrical engineering class. It covers a broad range of topics and lets students get their hands dirty.	Make the labs available online, give less weight to that quiz, but continue to be the same great professor.		f	f	dept_lab	12	12	\N	\N	Objectives are laid out very clearly, class run well, expectations met.

Applications are drawn broadly from engineering and physics, including feedback and control, communications, and signal processing.	The class covered the basics of signal and systems, including Laplace Transforms, Z-Transforms, and Fourier Transforms.  It was fairly theoretical, but there were applications drawn from many different engineering disciplines, and this balanced out the theory.  Students felt that they developed good intuition as well as a respect for the variety of applications of signals and systems.	Professor Freeman\nApplications\nLectures and recitations	Fast pace\nLots of math\nNot enough sample problems	Most students took the class to fulfill Course VI requirements.  it is a prerequisite for 6.011.  Some students also took the class because of an interest in the material.  Students recommended the class for anyone with any interest in signals or systems, or electrical engineering in general.	Students felt that the problem sets were too long, and often very hard.  They had a lot of math, which was tedious at times.  It was very helpful to work with others or attend office hours to complete them.  Understanding the problems sets helped on the exams.	The Engineering Design problems in the problem sets served as labs.  They were fun, but often hard to start, and generally time consuming.	Some students found the grading policy too confusing, although others felt it was fair.  Because the problem sets were graded on a check-minus/check/check-plus scale, and the exams were out of 100, it was not clear how these two types of scores were merged.  The grading of exams was focused too heavily on correct answers, and did not give enough partial credit for correct thought processes.  Also, the majority of the final grade was determined after drop date.	The textbook was sometimes helpful, although the order of the material differed from the lectures.  The lecture slides and recitations were very useful.	The exams varied in difficulty.  However, they were written for less time than was allotted.  They only had four questions each.		The students asked for partial credit on exams, as well as feedback on problem sets.  There were also requests for tutorials to be brought back.	http://mit.edu/6.003/S10/www/index.html	f	f	core	12	4	\N	\N	Students felt that the class successfully met its objectives.

The first area is design. The course covers how to design good user interfaces, starting with human capabilities (including the human information processor model, perception, motor skills, color, and attention) and using those capabilities to drive design techniques: task analysis, user-centered design, iterative design, usability guidelines, and graphic design principles. The second area is implementation.  The course covers techniques for building user interfaces, including low-fidelity prototypes, Wizard of Oz, and other prototyping tools; input models, output models, model-view-controller, layout, constraints, declarative user interfaces, and toolkits. The third area is evaluation. The course covers techniques for evaluating and measuring interface usability, including heuristic evaluation, predictive evaluation, and user testing.\n\nNecessary prerequisites are significant programming experience and prior exposure to some graphical user interface programming.  6.005 provides both of these prerequisites, but students can get them other ways.  6.813/6.831 is not merely a design class; we actually build software, so programming skills are required.\n\nThe most important take-home concept from 6.813/6.831 is the importance of iterative design.  If the basic message of a course like 6.005 might be described as &amp;quot;think first, code second&amp;quot;, then 6.813/6.831 refines that message to &amp;quot;think, code, evaluate, and then think again.&amp;quot;  Another important message of 6.831 is that you are not the user -- if you design only for yourself, and what you think is appropriate, you won't produce usable software.\n\nCollaboration is encouraged -- students may discuss the assignments with each other, but all written and programming work on individual problem sets must be done by individuals.  Using bibles of past problem set solutions is not allowed.\n\n	Students learned the principles of UI design, how to run usability experiments, and how to build a good user interface.  There was a good balance between theory and application, with useful and interesting content.  There were problem sets which used Flex to practice making an interface, and there was a group project where students would design and test their own interface.

Other students were interested in UI or heard that the professor was good.	Students did not like the problem sets which required the use of Flex.  Many of the UI concepts were fairly simple to grasp, but programming them in Flex took a long time.  Collaboration was helpful, and students felt that the problem sets did not relate to what was taught in class.	The main assignment in this class was the group final design project.  Although it was an excellent chance to apply the concepts they had learned in class, some students felt that not enough time was given to actually code the final project.	Students felt that the quiz grading seemed unfair since many of the UI concepts are subjective.  In general, the grading was not very transparent since no clear comments were given on the grades for the projects.  Grading was slow, and students wished that they would have received feedback sooner.  Grades were very high in the class, so students were unsure of where the A/B dividing line would be.	While there was no textbook for the class, the lecture notes and accompanying slides were very detailed and helpful, especially in preparation for nanoquizzes.	There were no exams in the class. Students had mixed feelings about the eight nanoquizzes, which each had two or three multiple choice questions.  Some students felt that they were very subjective and ambiguous.  Other students felt that the quizzes were easy if you read the lecture notes.	'Everywhere I go, all I see are UIs (computer and other) and I can't help but evaluate. Unfortunately, most of them are bad.'	Students would have liked the TAs to be more available outside of class.

The homeworks and project involve parallel programming on real multicore systems. Topics include:\n\nIntroduction to key multicore applications in scientific computing, signal processing, embedded networking and digital video and audio; Parallel computing models including shared memory, streams, and messaging; Parallel programming techniques; VLSI technology and multicore constraints; Communications and interconnection networks; Multicore caching and memory systems, shared memory and cache coherence, messaging and streaming; Multicore processor design and synchronization; and performance evaluation methodologies.\n\nThe course comprises lectures, readings, homeworks, and a substantial project.\n\nWhy should students take this particular elective?\n\nParallel computing has become a hot area for research and development. Our computing industry has recently made a  disruptive shift from sequential computers to multicores in virtually every domain including scientific and desktop computers, laptops, cellphones, TVs, home media servers, web and networking systems, gaming machines, and automobiles. By covering the software and hardware foundations of parallel computing, this course will prepare you for research, teaching, or cutting edge industrial development in software, hardware or applications. \n\nThis class is particularly applicable to research since the area of parallel computing -- particularly  involving hundreds or thousands of processor cores --  is a hot research area, rich with open problems in multicore operating systems, architecture, compilers, programming languages, databases, and applications.\n\nWho should take this course?\n\nStudents with a diverse set of backgrounds from virtually any engineering discipline can take this course. Prerequisites include an undergraduate course in computer architecture (e.g., MIT's 6.004). \n\nWhat is the collaboration policy?\n\nStudents are strongly encouraged to collaborate on assignments. The final project is accomplished by teams of two to four students. However, the writeups and presentations should be prepared individually.\n\nIf students keep one or two concepts from this subject, what do you hope they would be?\n\nThink parallel.  \n\nTechnology changes demand a rethinking of basic computer architecture fundamentals.\n\nWhat is your teaching philosophy for this subject?\n\nI try to de-emphasize grades, and try to encourage students to have fun, focus on learning cool new stuff, and be creative.\n	Students learned about software and hardware concepts related to multicore computing. Some students liked the balance between application and theory; a few wanted more application. The material dealt with the current state of parallel computing and implementations. It discussed the advantages and disadvantages of different implementations. Much of it focused on the Tilera architecture.

It also fulfilled a graduate requirement.	Students liked the problem sets, saying they were straightforward, fun, and relatively easy. They were fair and helpful for absorbing the material. Most of it was mathematical, back-of-the-envelope analysis of different problems. There were five in total, with one being optional. There were only a few complaints, being that there weren't enough problem sets and that they involved a lot of pseudo-back-of-the-envelope-calculations as opposed to code. Also, debugging the code on a 64 core machine was challenging.	There was an open-ended final project for the class. Students found the project fun and interesting, as well as rewarding.\n\nSome students complained that the final project was too open ended, and that they were unsure what the specifications were.	Most students were unsure of how well they were doing in the class, but said that the grading seemed fair. Problem sets were graded relatively easily.	There were class notes as well as papers relevant to the lectures. Students did not feel the printed lecture slides were terribly useful, as they did not explain many of the diagrams. However, some students said that they were useful on problem sets. There was no textbook.	None.	Point of class is to have fun.\n	Faster grading\nMake qdel available earlier\nStricter deadlines\nMore problem sets\nMore in depth expectations for the final project	http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.846/	f	f	SYS	12	4	\N	\N	Objectives were clearly stated and followed through.

Since students have varying degrees of past experiences in these areas, and because we present and build upon basic material, we recognize that some students may find parts of the course obvious, frustrating, and, on occasion, seemingly patronizing. However, no matter the experience level, there is always room for improvement. This is an unusual class in that the course's objective is to provide guidance and feedback as students complete the various assignments (rather than to teach a specific body of technical knowledge). Students get out of the class what they put into these assignments, and we invite them to 1) take the initiative to create custom value for themselves, 2) use the materials, exercises and assignments to try new things, 3) improve their abilities in these important skills, and 4) develop their own personal style. We hope that students take the time to use 6.UAT as an opportunity to experiment and hone their skills -- an activity better done now, in a supportive environment with little consequence, as opposed to later, when mistakes can be professionally costly. The course is continually evolving, and we welcome input and suggestions for improvement. Finally, although not required, it is helpful if students have a thesis project or potential project topic in mind when starting the class.	The class heavily emphasized oral presentation skills, and was a combination of lecture and recitation. Students felt that recitations were the most useful portion of the class, with lecture being less useful, but many students greatly enjoyed the lectures. Recitations were a combination of prepared and impromptu speaking assignments, and students felt that they learned the most through actually presenting.\n\nThe class focuses on technical presentation skills, as well as having modules on negotiation, networking, and professional communication.

The subjects include diffusion, osmosis, carrier mediated transport, ion transport, and electrical response of cells (Hodgkin-Huxley model). \n\nThis graduate course would be building the fundamentals for any biomedical research, and especially useful for students who are interested in neuroscience / engineering. Class meets with undergraduate class (6.021), but the assignments (in both homeworks / exams) are different. \n\nThis course is intended for juniors and seniors in engineering school, who have previously taken at least one engineering subject at the sophomore level. It involves various engineering mathematical concepts, so some familiarity with those would help students a lot. \n\nThe teach staffs' goals are 1) Teach / reinforce the most fundamental transport concepts 2) Teach / reinforce the scientific communication skills 3) Introduce the fundamentals of neuroscience to the students. Personally, I think the concept of Hodgkin-Huxley model would be very interesting and useful for students to remember for their future career. \n\nCollaboration to solve homework problem is encouraged, but students should note any collaobration in their work. Some of the projects are requiring students to collaborate, and both students in a team will get the same grade in the end. Bibles do exist and some students use them, but relying on bibles entirely is not recommended since it robs the chance for students to struggle with the new concept and learn properly. Historically, students who did their homeworks on their own had performed better on the exams. \n\nThe course content will be mostly stable for a few years to come, but we may introduce some new examples (especially in the area of neuroscience / engineering) in the future.\n	The class serves as an excellent intro to quantitative biology and neuroscience, in particular how information is encoded in action potential trains.

One student's suggestion: &quot;My initial reaction to the list of HH hypotheses was that they seemed very simplistic. What I didn't realize is that you can pursue a simple hypothesis deeply into the model more easily, which can be better than choosing a more elaborate hypothesis.

Some students felt that the Professor could have covered more topics by compromising the rigor and thoroughness with which some topics were covered (like Fourier Optics). Students found the subject material very relevant to research and lab work (fibers, dielectrics, interferometers), but also found the class very time consuming.	Problem sets\nPowerful tools	Very difficult\nVery time consuming\nPain and suffering	Almost all students in the class were involved in some form of optics research whether it's a thesis or work in the field. That motivated them to take the class. 	The problem sets were difficult and time consuming, but very useful.  They forced students to solve hard problems and in doing so, develop indispensable problem solving skills.  Collaboration was useful for most. 	Some design projects that were part of the problem sets were useful, and there was a mini research project on x-ray  imaging for which students didn't have any strong positive or negative feelings.	Students felt that the grading was fair, and as a graduate level class was A/B centered. Students took turns grading each others' problem sets. 	Students used the textbooks by Hermann Haus, Amnon Yariv,and Saleh. Although altogether they make a good optics bible, students found that the class notes were more useful because they were less compact and more readable.  	Professor Fujimoto believes that if you know something well, you can do it quickly. The first quiz was a speed test, whereas the second focused more on conceptual concepts/tricks. Students found that the format changed quickly so you didn't know what to expect. Also, the lack of practice material made it difficult to prepare.		Students felt that more topics could have been covered (for instance only 3 chapters out of Haus' book were covered during the whole term).

Since students have varying degrees of past experience in these areas, and because we present and build upon basic material, we recognize that some students may find parts of the course obvious, frustrating, and, on occasion, seemingly patronizing. However, no matter the experience level, there is always room for improvement. This is an unusual class in that the course's objective is to provide guidance and feedback as students complete the various assignments (rather than to teach a specific body of technical knowledge). Students get out of the class what they put into these assignments, and we invite them to 1) take the initiative to create customized value for themselves, 2) use the exercises and assignments to try new things, 3) improve their abilities in these important skills, and 4) develop their own personal style. We hope that students take the time to use 6.UAT as an opportunity to experiment and hone their skills -- an activity better done now, in a supportive environment with little consequence, as opposed to later, when mistakes can be professionally costly. The course is continually evolving, and we welcome input and suggestions for improvement. Finally, although not required, it is helpful if students have a thesis project or potential project topic in mind when starting the class.	6.UAT taught skills for giving effective presentations and speaking confidently.

Students generally thought the amount of information packed into a week of lectures was a bit overwhelming. The lectures moved quickly going over numerous technologies without diving deeply into any one area. The lecturers were graduate students with the addition of a few guest lectures from industry supporters. Thus, the quality of the  lectures varied a great deal. Deciding which technologies to focus on and use for website was left to the students.\n\nThree milestones and the final site made up all the work for the class. Completing the milestones help to ensure the website was on track to finish in time. The final project was very open-ended. A general problem was given, but it was up to each team to define how they wanted to tackle it. The only requirements were including some very general functionality that could be incorporated in numerous ways. Building the website was definitely challenging and required a great of time, but it was also the most rewarding part. This was where many students learned the most. \n\nBe prepared to do research in addition to lectures to learn how to actually use the mentioned web technologies.

Our approach is to understand how to build the &amp;quot;learning healthcare system&amp;quot;, which implies a need to learn from clinical experience and to integrate insights from genomics and biology into health care. We begin by examining the sources of data available to researchers in health care, then present a set of methods to build models from such data, and conclude by looking at applications of these ideas. A number of lectures and guest lecturers introduce application areas such as electronic medical records, personal health records, radiology systems, public health surveillance, intensive care monitoring, systems for the developing world, running a health research enterprise, etc.\n\nThe subject is appropriate for anyone interested in understanding the challenges and opportunities for computational research in health care.  Students should have a 6.034 level of understanding of machine learning, and should have had some system building experience. The class is an elective, and some students have used is as an excellent entry portal into research.\n\nThe class is based on readings, lectures and discussion, and students complete group projects and present them in class. Collaboration on projects is highly encouraged, but homework assignments are to be done individually.  One main lesson is that &amp;quot;data are terrible things to waste;&amp;quot; to improve health care, we need to take critical advantage of everything we find out about the care of individual patients and populations.\n\nWe are writing up our class notes to become a text, so future versions of the course are likely to be influenced by the evolution of our thinking as we do so.

This is a TQE subject. My teaching philosophy is to emphasize intuition. Concepts to keep: 1. Power = f(Complexity, Technology, Topology, Speed, Precision) 2. Mastery of Feedback = Mastery of Circuits. No bibles are allowed. Students are allowed to collaborate.	The focus of this class is ultra low power circuit design with a focus on understanding and treating for noise.

This subject covers: Resonant circuits and control of the associated bandwidth; Diodes, Transistors, Junction Field-Effect Transistors, Operational Amplifiers; basic analog circuit design as applied to audio and radio frequency circuits.\nStudents spend the second half of the term designing and building their own projects.\nThis course satisfies both the EECS Dept. and the Institute Lab requirements.\n2.  This class is an Elective.  Students should take it to learn analog circuits and circuit design, to participate in a group design project that simulates design practices in industry, or to satisfy the MIT or the EECS Department Lab requirement; to work with expert analog engineers from local analog companies.\nSeveral graduate students have taken this course to get background for research work.\n3.  Students who want to learn analog circuits and who like hands-on lab work should take 6.101.  Also, those who would like to work closely with the instructor and local analog engineers from industry on design projects. Many students from courses 2, 8, 16, 18, 22 find this course useful.\nA student needs to understand the basic principles of electronic circuit analysis well, i. e. 6.002 or equivalent such as 6.071.\n4.  My teaching philosophy is to minimize mathematical transfer functions and solutions and to emphasize visual and intuitive circuit understanding; to create a practical and useful design experience.  In the process, students will learn to understand and use a wide variety of analog circuits.  They will learn how to use books, periodicals, and websites to find circuit ideas and to supplement their textbook knowledge.  Additionally, 6.101 is supported during the project phase by engineers from local analog companies.  These engineers come to MIT to help students with their projects in person, as well as providing assistance via phone and e-mail.\n5.  Collaboration, etc.:  The six laboratory exercises are individual efforts.  Parts of each lab are changed each term.  Problem sets are individual efforts.  The projects are group projects [teams of 3] but each person contributing to the project is graded individually.\n6.  The WWW:  staff limitations have made it difficult to make the large volume of materials for 6.101 available on the web. I would rather see the TA spend time in lab helping students than spend time preparing class materials to post on the web.  However, the web is used extensively to get device specifications from semiconductor manufacturers, to find circuit design ideas, and to order parts for projects.  \n\n7.  The following companies are now supporting 6.101:  Analog Devices Inc., The Bose Corporation, Linear Technology Corporation, Intersil, and Silicon Labs.\n	This is an introductory lab class in analog circuit design.  It teaches practical knowledge of circuit design, with emphasis on applications and not theory.  The class applies everything learned in earlier classes to build practical analog circuits.  It is a very difficult, time consuming class, but gives students invaluable experience in analog circuit design.

The primary demographic it appeals to is underclassmen who plan on taking 6.01 yet lack the programming background. Other students may take it just for the sake of learning a programming language, perhaps exploring their interest in a CS field. \n\nThis subject caters to those who have little no no experience in programming. If you know a programming language already, you'll be bored to tears. 6.S090 is our &amp;amp;quot;sister class&amp;amp;quot;, aimed at those who already know a language and want to learn Python.\n\nThe fundamental principle of programming, in general, is recognizing how to break down a goal into a bunch of concrete, discrete steps to take. That's pretty much what we're trying to get students to think about. Beyond that, we encourage good programming practices e.g. style, commenting, documenting etc...\n\nStudents are allowed to collaborate. However, as with all classes, we do not tolerate straight-up cheating.\n\n(I know for a fact I'll be teaching the subject again) We'll work on fixing up the way we did checkoffs to make it a little more painless. As far as content goes, we're pretty happy. There's just some logistical stuff that needs to be figured out here and there.	This class provided an introduction to Python and to basic programming concepts. The course took a very hands-on approach to programming and is designed for beginners with no prior programming experience.	P/D/F\nHelpful TA's	Homeworks sometimes released late\nNot enough staff/office hours	Students took this course to get exposure to programming, and to prepare for 6.01 (Introduction to EECS).	The problem sets could be long, but were very relevant to the concepts being taught and were useful for learning the material. 	Labs were very useful and helped to clarify concepts learned in class. In-lab projects helped students master the material.	This class was graded P/D/F, with the criteria for passing being based on effort. Students felt this was fair and encouraged learning.

Topics include parallelism, load balancing,  communication and synchronization primitives, memory hierarchy, on-chip interconnection networks, and cache coherence. Using a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) board, programmed with a simple multicore processor and a minimal software environment, students develop Verilog and software to implement different hardware/software designs for caches, messages, shared memory, and coordination primitives. The labs culminate in a term project which students describe in a design paper and in-class presentation. The course also provides instruction in written and oral communication.\nWhy should students take this particular elective? If appropriate, comment on the applicability of this class to research. \nParallel computing is hot, as our computing industry has recently made a disruptive shift from sequential computers to multicores. By covering the design and implementation of multicore computer systems, this course will prepare you for research or for cutting edge industrial development in parallel computing systems. Furthermore, whether you are destined for research or industry, the hands-on labs give you experience with the nuts and bolts of  FPGA development, multicore implementation and concurrent software. \n\nThis class is particularly applicable to research since the area of parallel computing -- particularly  involving hundreds or thousands of processor cores – is at the frontier of computer science research, rich with open problems in multicore architecture and associated software systems.\n\nWho should take this subject? Who should not? What should students know before taking this class? \n\nThe course is targeted towards undergraduate and MEng students in the EECS department. However, due to the pervasiveness of parallel computing, students with a diverse set of backgrounds from virtually any engineering discipline will find this course useful. Students should be familiar with the basics of sequential processor architecture and programming (e.g., instruction sets, processor building blocks such as ALUs and register files, pipelining, caches, memory hierarchy, basic programming). Prerequisites include an introductory undergraduate course in computer architecture (e.g., MIT's 6.004).\n\nWhat is your teaching philosophy for this subject? \n\nOur teaching philosophy involves a combination of lectures and hands-on lab exercises on real hardware to develop both theoretical and practical engineering insights into multicore computer systems. The lectures are discussion oriented and follow the Socratic method – students are encouraged to think of solutions in real time to issues related to various design choices during lectures. \n\nIf students keep one or two concepts from this subject, what do you hope they would be?\n\nTwo key concepts to take away from this course: Good computer architecture involves making tradeoffs in both hardware and software.  Solutions to architecture problems will be different as technology changes, so understand fundamental approaches to design as opposed to specific solutions.\n\nWhat is the collaboration policy for this subject? Are students allowed or encouraged to work on assignments in groups? Are they allowed to use bibles? \n\nStudents are encouraged to collaborate on assignments, but the coding and writeups must be their own.  Students are strongly encouraged to do the final project in teams of two including a joint presentation and writeup.\n\nIf you teach this subject again, what will be different? \n\nThis was the first time this course was offered, so there is certainly room for improvement. We would start the reading assignments earlier in the term. Future offerings would also benefit from both the labs and Beehive having become more robust as a result of the high degree of usage this term. We would also like to hear from the students how they would like the course to evolve based on their experience this first time around.\n\n\n	This class is about software design for multicore systems.  The class covers a lot of material in parallel programming and multicore systems and does a good job of covering both theoretical topics and applications in labs.	Professor Agarwal\nTAs\nFun labs\nLectures	Reading assignments\nTime consuming labs\nVerilog	Students who took this class were course 6 students looking for a lab who were also interested in parallel application development.	N/A	Students generally enjoyed the labs and found them very interesting/reasonable.  However, some students had trouble debugging and using Verilog and noted that the labs diverged from the lectures.	Students found the grading hard to judge, but overall found it fair in the end.	N/A	The single midterm was very fair, even though there were no problem sets to back up the material.  Students found that the exam was a good reflection of what they should have already known by that point.		Some suggestions submitted were\n1.)  Getting a larger multicore computer.\n2.)  Producing a class journal with final reports of all students for students to access during project presentations.\n3.)  Ramp up in hardware lab difficulty.\n4.)  Tour of the Beehive FPGA boards in the machine room.\n5.)

My approach is to cover only the essential physics elements for understanding and rigorous modeling of the MOSFET device, and to use only this device in circuit design applications.  A continuous thread through the first half of this subject is model building for the MOSFET with emphasis on complexity reduction via sound physical approximations to arrive at a practical piecewise model;  for the second half the model is simplified further to allow for intuitive, yet reasonably quantitative applications to circuit analysis and design.  This header subject is an essential stepping-stone towards more advanced subjects in device physics (e.g. 6.720) or circuit design (e.g. 6.301, 6.374, etc.)\n\nHomework and a design project are key elements of the learning experience for this subject.  As such, I expect the students to work on their own; use of bibles is discouraged.\n\n	The course included a lot of analysis of MOSFET's and other general device physics.

Some took it because they were interested in electronics.	Responses to the problem sets varied. Some people found the problem sets to be short and easy, while others thought they were long and hard. Most agreed that they were useful for learning the material but involved too many calculations.	The course had a final design project of reasonable length. Students had to learn to use SPICE (Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis). The project did not help many students in understanding the material and many found that learning the software was more tedious than actually completing the project.	The grading policy was fair and mostly based on the quizzes and the design project. Grades were released on time but students didn't know how they would do in terms of final grades until after the final exam.	Both the textbooks and class notes were useful for understanding the concepts and were also great references for the problem sets. Some believed that the class notes were more useful than the textbook.	Quizzes were open notes, and followed the class material and problem sets well. They tested complete understanding of the material.	If you want to take this, be prepared for a lot of math.\nThe device physics covered in depth at the beginning makes seeing circuits later on much more welcome.	Bring in some applications.

The class is not required, but is extremely valuable if a student plans to work in the Microsystems Technology Lab or the Nanostructures Lab here at MIT. Additionally, the lab reports are in the form of an IEEE letter, an oral presentation, and a poster presentation as a way to further hone a student's technical communication skills. The take-home exam is a design project to completely design the fabrication of a relevant contemporary device and will use all of the knowledge acquired throughout the semester. Finally, the last day is a field trip to a local fab facility to see how device manufacturing is accomplished. This course was also evaluated using the MIT Evaluation site. Please search on web.mit.edu/subjectevaluation for more reviews.	Students learned about fabricating IC chips as well as other micro-scale devices, such as MEMS and microfluidics devices.

It requires a background in algorithms, machine architecture, and programming.  Its aim is to give students a clear understanding of the abstractions that computing systems implement and how to bridge the abstractions in order to make software applications run faster.  The course is organized around several substantial projects, including a large final project.  The projects are done in teams of two or three students.  Outside professional engineers provide feedback to students as part of code and design reviews.  We hope to institute TA-led sections when the class is taught next year to teach hands-on use of tools. 	This course teaches performance engineering -- basically, how to make programs run fast.

It covers a range of major topics, including computational data structures, programming, signals and systems, circuits, and planning and search.  Students interested in majoring in EECS will find the subject provides a good overview of many of the major areas of these disciplines, as well as providing technical background necessary to take foundational subjects in the department.  Students from other disciplines will find the broad coverage of topics a useful introduction to methods relevant to many other fields of engineering and science.  Prior experience in programming is important for students taking 6.01.  If students do not have significant prior experience, the subject provides access to tutorial material that can strengthen this background; in addition, typically there are IAP courses provided on Python.  Alternatively, students with very limited programming experience might consider taking 6.00 before taking 6.01.

The class had lecture notes but they didn't make sense without the context of the lecture. Only a few students used the optional textbook. Most students agreed that the course needed a good textbook and better lecture notes.	Exams seemed to concentrate more on theory than on the programming aspect of the course. To do well you need to understand all the intricacies of the material well.  Many exam questions required being able to read code and figure out what it does. Many students were frustrated because they found it difficult to be able to code on paper and also complained about the lack of partial credit on exams.

Both groups of students appreciated the breadth and depth of the subjects and found the course very useful.	Fast pace\nLots of lab time\nInstructors	Poor organization\nProblem set errors	Students took this course to either learn C++ or a new programming language in general. Students thought that getting programming experience would be useful for majors other than Course VI, for UROPs, and for internships. Taking a course was helpful for students who wanted to learn in a more structured environment than reading a book on their own.	The problem sets were very useful for learning the material and for enabling students to gauge what they did and didn't understand. Problem sets were challenging, especially for novice programmers, but were not too long. By far the most common criticism was that there were far too many problem set corrections issued by the instructors. Students wished the instructors had sorted out all the issues with the problem sets ahead of time.	Labs were used mostly for working on problem sets and the final project. Lab hours were adequately supervised and the instructors provided help to students who needed it, but wait times could sometimes be long. Students found the design project to be interesting, a reasonable length, and an excellent capstone to tie together all the material learned in the course.	Most students thought that the grading was fair, especially since the course was P/D/F. Occasionally grading errors were made on the problem sets, and students felt that some instructors graded much harder than others.	Online lecture notes were generally useful.

Systems that employ embedded micro-control are all around you: CD and MP3 players, kitchen appliances like microwave ovens, cellular phones, calculators, television sets, and high performance aircraft, to name a few.  In ways you may not realize, even very familiar consumer products that existed in some form before the microprocessor benefit in their contemporary incarnations from microcontrollers.  A modern, high-end luxury automobile will typically contain more than a dozen microcontrollers to provide everything from engine and emissions control to music programming.  This class is your passport into the world of people who love to build elegant, efficient systems that work.\n\nCourse topics include optical tomography, multi-axis robot arm control, video and audio signal processing, power electronics including laptop power supplies and fluorescent lamp ballasts, and numeric computation (calculators and floating point calculations). This class is not particularly about learning how a specific microcontroller is programmed, or about designing circuits, or about wiring chips together.  We do a little of all of these things, but our real goal is to introduce you to a palette of tools and techniques that let you build what you can imagine.  These techniques are much more general than the details of a single processor or programming language.  Chips come and go, but successful approaches for engineering design have a life that spans many iterations of a particular technology.  \n\nStudents build a PIC microcontroller development system. You can keep this system and your course multimeter if you complete the class.\n	This was a class that applied all of the theory students learned to building something real and interesting. In the grand scheme of things, it taught students how to think about and design embedded systems. Material presented was interesting, practical, and immediately applicable.	Steve Leeb \nLectures and labs\nUseful applications of microcontrollers\nFinal project flexibility\nHands-on learning\n	Extremely time consuming\nDebugging\nGrading policy\nNo handouts or online lecture notes	Most students took this class because they wanted to learn about microcontrollers, improve their EE skills, and build things. Some wanted a challenging and rewarding class. 	There were no problem sets.	The entire class was based on labs. They were quite long but well-designed, and forced students to learn the material very well. Labs were very time-intensive - students found it necessary to start early.	The grading was split in the following way: 50% labs, 20% final project, 25% midterm, 5% attendance. An A was an 85 or above. Most students felt that grading was fair, but some thought it was too harsh and subjective depending on the TA who did your checkoff.	The class notes were very helpful for the design projects and gave many hints for the labs, but were only available in lecture. Lecture notes were not posted online, so it was difficult for students to catch up on material if they missed a class. The textbook was a useful reference, but not required for the class.	All students felt that the quiz was hard. Some thought it was fair and practical, but others believed it tested material that was too obscure. 	Lots of time. SO MUCH TIME.\n\nThe worst part about this class is that when you leave the lab at midnight for the second night in a row, you can't be mad at the class because what you're doing is so awesome. The labs are long, but well structured to give you a wide exposure to different topics. And the skills I've gained in debugging are immense.

Some took it to fulfill MEng requirements, or to prepare for research projects.	Problem sets were considered to be useful overall; they helped several students absorb the material from lecture. Students used office hours, and some collaborated to complete the assignments. They did not use bibles.	The final project gave students significant freedom to research an aspect of MRI of their choosing.

It is organized in four modules: software engineering, signals and systems, circuits, and probability and planning. Prior experience in programming is important, and the subject includes tutorial material that can strengthen this background. Students with very limited programming experience might consider taking the IAP subject in Python or 6.00 before taking 6.01.	The course was an introduction to the electrical engineering and computer science subject material that a student encounters in the Course 6 department. The class taught concepts such as simple circuits, signals and systems, object-oriented programming, and state machines through the use of online tutor problems and in-class labs.	Labs\nRobots	Too much work\nToo much breadth and not enough depth\nUnclear objectives\nNot enough TAs\n	Most students took this course to satisfy the EECS department requirement. Some students who were not in Course VI took this course to gain exposure to basic EECS material.	There were weekly online tutor problems that were meant to reinforce basic concepts and were not excessively challenging. This class also had homework assignments, which were more comprehensive and challenging. Many students commented that the wording on the homework problems was unclear. Many felt that the homework problems took too long to complete and did not always go along with the course material. In contrast, most students thought that the tutor problems were helpful in reinforcing the material that was taught in class.	The course had in-class labs that were centered around programming and designing circuits for robots. As the class progressed, students added more and more levels of complexity to the robot's brain and sensor circuits. There were mixed opinions about the labs. Some students felt that the labs were useful for learning the material and that the length was reasonable, while others felt that the labs were too long and that the partner system negatively affected their learning. Some students were not always able to finish the labs during class and had to go to office hours outside of class in order to finish and get the checkoffs.	The grading was very fair, as a large portion of the grade came from online tutor problems and lab checkoffs. \nThere were also occasional interviews between a TA and the student where the TA would assess the student's understanding of the material. Some students felt that the grades for the interviews were too subjective and varied too much depending on the TA giving the interview.	The class provided course notes that were available online. The notes were very comprehensive, but sometimes too long-winded when students just wanted some quick reference knowledge. The course notes contained all the information necessary to learn the material in the class.	The questions on the exams reflected the type of questions that were seen on the weekly assignments. Students felt that the exams were reasonable and fair. Getting a good score was easy for students who kept up with the course material. The exams were also open note.\n\nIn addition to the exams, there were also weekly nanoquizzes, which were completed in the first fifteen minutes of class. The quizzes reinforced material from lecture and were fairly easy, each consisting of a few short questions.		Students suggested that the lab partner system should be done away with. Students also wished that there were more LAs who knew the material well. Students felt that better lectures would have improved their understanding of the course material. Lab instructions could have been released further ahead of time and could have been much clearer.		f	f	core	12	6	\N	\N	The class achieved its objectives and covered all the material that it was supposed to, although the objectives were not really that tough.

Specifically, it covers the fundamentals of the lumped circuit abstraction. Resistive elements and networks; independent and dependent sources; switches and MOS devices; digital abstraction; amplifiers; and energy storage elements. Dynamics of first- and second-order networks; design in the time and frequency domains; operational amplifiers; analog and digital circuits and applications.\n\nThis subject is highly recommended to all EECS engineers as it makes the connection between physics and the kinds of systems that EECS engineers build. \n\nThe prerequisites for this subject (8.02 and 18.03 or 18.06) are genuine and strictly enforced. \n\nMy teaching philosophy is to emphasize conceptual understanding and to motivate learning by conveying the exciting possibilities of the subject material. Although some of it is necessary, I like to deemphasize circuit solving drudgery, and instead focus on the intuitive solution process. I also emphasize hands-on learning through the lab projects and an online  experimental laboratory Websim. \n\nI encourage students to work together. Many students learn better this way. However, the work they turn in must be written up individually. I take a neutral stance on bibles -- they can be helpful if used as an aid to learning.\n	The class talked about solving linear circuits, MOSFETS, and RLC circuits. The material built cumulatively and was a good balance between application and theory. There was a bit of review at the beginning for the benefit of those with less experience, however, it ramped up quickly.\n\n	Well-liked Professors\nGood content: Circuits\n	Exam-heavy grading\nLA-light labs	Most took this for their 6-1 or 6-2 requirement. However, non-majors and majors alike cited an interest in circuits as a strong driver for choosing this class.	The problem sets were, in general, quite useful and relevant. Most contained some long problems (due to algebra) and some painful problems (due to difficulty). While they took more time then their 5% grade weighting suggested, their utility for learning materials and doing well on the test made them worthwhile.	The two labs (first one on MOSFETs and the second building an audio system) were interesting though a bit long. The pre-labs were helpful although tedious and time consuming. The lab equipment was fragile at best and the Lab Assistants were understaffed and not very helpful.	Most students found the grading to be fair. The grading scheme was weighted heavily towards the exams, which some students found onerous, especially since the homework and labs took non-trivial time to complete.	Those who read the textbook found it well-written and helpful. Others found the class notes to be sufficient (though problem sets contained questions from the book).	Most students found the exams to be fair. They were cumulative, but doing the homework was good preparation. Comparatively easier than the homework, the exams had some tricks that were meant to test real understanding rather than rote learning. Overall, these tests were challenging and well-written, and with preparation, doable.	Agarwal is SO F***ING AWESOME. No other instructor will bring a chainsaw into class.	Some students would like more labs, though staffing the current labs better and fixing a couple broken oscilloscopes should probably take higher priority.\n\nHowever, the desire for some more applications, either through labs or demos would be much appreciated.\n\nGrading wise, some students would have liked a less exam heavy grading policy.	http://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/6/fa11/6.002/index.html	f	f	core	12	4	\N	\N	The class followed and completed the objectives on the syllabus.

However, some students found the instructions of the labs to be confusing at times. Responses about difficulty and length of the problem sets varied from long and hard to reasonable.	The labs for this course were the Python tasks in the problem sets.

This class is an Elective.  Students should take it to learn analog circuits and circuit design, to participate in a group design project that simulates design practices in industry, or to satisfy the MIT or the EECS Department Lab requirement; to work with expert analog engineers from local analog companies.\nSeveral graduate students have taken this course to get background for research work.\n3.  Students who want to learn analog circuits and who like hands-on lab work should take 6.101.  Also, those who would like to work closely with the instructor and local analog engineers from industry on design projects. Many students from courses 2, 8, 16, 18, 22 find this course useful.\nA student needs to understand the basic principles of electronic circuit analysis well, i. e. 6.002 or equivalent such as 6.071.\n4.  My teaching philosophy is to minimize mathematical transfer functions and solutions and to emphasize visual and intuitive circuit understanding; to create a practical and useful design experience.  In the process, students will learn to understand and use a wide variety of analog circuits.  They will learn how to use books, periodicals, and websites to find circuit ideas and to supplement their textbook knowledge.  Additionally, 6.101 is supported during the project phase by engineers from local analog companies.  These engineers come to MIT to help students with their projects in person, as well as providing assistance via phone and e-mail.\n5.  Collaboration, etc.:  The six laboratory exercises are individual efforts.  Parts of each lab are changed each term.  Problem sets are individual efforts.  The projects are group projects [teams of 3] but each person contributing to the project is graded individually.\n6.  The WWW:  staff limitations have made it difficult to make the large volume of materials for 6.101 available on the web. I would rather see the TA spend time in lab helping students than spend time preparing class materials to post on the web.  However, the web is used extensively to get device specifications from semiconductor manufacturers, to find circuit design ideas, and to order parts for projects.  \n\n7.

Labs were very time consuming but very useful to learning and applying concepts.	Grading was considered to be fair overall.	Students thought the textbook was helpful on occasion, but it did not cover the material in the same manner as lectures, which made it hard to use as a reference.	Exams required full understanding of the material, and students were disappointed practice exams were not made available.

Since the primary language was Java, there was heavy emphasis on how things are done in it and its little quirks. The team-based projects provided a realistic scenario of what it is like to be a developer.  	Projects\nPiazza\nMaterial	Exams\nDisorganization\nRecitation\nLong lectures	Most people took this subject because it is a requirement for both 6-3 and 18C. Many of them also wanted to learn about software engineering and to be better programmers.	Problem sets were fair and useful. They could be done independently.  The questions were sometimes unclear, which made it difficult to tell whether one's answer was right or not. Grading also felt a little arbitrary. Overall, these problem sets are much easier than typical MIT problem sets. 	In total there were five labs and two projects. The labs were all manageable and provided a good introduction to the projects. They were given out ahead of lab time, so many students started and completed them before the three hours of lab, and just came in for checkoffs. Consequently, lab hours degraded to getting check offs, rather than helping students with the material. \n\nThe two projects took up large amounts of time. The first project focused primarily on creating postscript in Java. Many students found this a bit boring. The TAs were not as helpful with this project since few of them knew postscript. The second project was much more interesting. It focused on creating the game of Antibattleship in Java, which required teams to use everything they learned from the class. This project was much longer than the first, so be prepared to devote time in order to do well.	Many students thought the grading system was fair, but there seemed to be a great deal of confusion about how specific assignments were graded. Project grading was not fully explained to students, which some thought was unfair. Also, there was some variation between TA, but the staff tried to even this out in the end.	There was no textbook. Lecture notes/slides and online Java tutorial comprised all of the written resources. The lecture notes were either in textbook style or slides depending on the topic. The textbook style notes were very helpful and written specifically for the class.	There were two exams. Some questions seemed to be too focused on small details in java that would be easy to look up in practice. There were also very few practice questions available. Thus, the exams didn't accurately measure how well students knew the material. Students generally felt that more projects and labs would have be better.		Students believed that the exams should be replaced with more projects. More time should be given for the final project. There should be more written lectures notes like the ones from Professor Devadas. Overall the class could be organized better.	http://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/6/fa11/6.005/index.html	f	f	core	12	4	\N	\N	There was a great deal of mixed emotions about how well the objectives were satisfied.

Topics included polarization properties of light; reflection and refraction; coherence and interference; Fraunhofer and Fresnel diffraction; holography; Fourier optics; coherent and incoherent imaging and signal processing systems; optical properties of materials; lasers and LEDs; electro-optic and acousto-optic light modulators; photorefractive and liquid-crystal light modulation; display technologies; optical waveguides and fiber-optic communication systems; photodetectors. \n\nCovering this much material was not easy. Many hours were sucked into doing problem sets, pre-lab, and post-lab. However, it was worth it, especially after building a hologram. 	Final Project\nMaking a hologram\nSmall class size	Lots of work	This class was perfect students with a great interest in optics. It built upon 6.003, and created a solid base of knowledge in both signals and optics. Be prepared to work and learn a lot. 	There were three assignments each week: one problem set, one pre-lab, and one post-lab. They were extremely useful and essential to getting the most out of the class, but they took a great deal of work and time. 	Although long, the labs demonstrated all the concepts covered in the class, fortifying a wealth of knowledge.	The grading was fair. It focused mainly on participation, since the professor knew each of the students on an individual basis.	Class notes were available, but there were not enough responses concerning their usefulness to reach a consensus. One student recommended the textbook &quot;Optics&quot; by Eugene Hecht.

Interesting material\nCool algorithms\nProfessors	Problem set grading\nPoor administration\nNo feedback\nLittle help from staff\nTAs\n	Most people took this subject because it satisfies the CS foundation requirement and is a prerequisite for 6.046. Many people were very interested in learning about algorithms and thought the materials were very useful for their future careers as programmers.	Most students thought the problem sets were long and difficult, and often required collaboration. However, they were useful for learning the materials and became progressively more interesting throughout the term. Many students thought that the problems sets were not as valuable as what they could've been due to slow grading and lack of feedback.	N/A	The exam grading was fair. Problem sets grading, however, was extremely slow and nontransparent. Some students didn't receive their early problem set grades until the end of the term and overall grades were released only days before the drop date. Students received little feedback and many thought it was difficult to study for exams without knowing how well they did on the problem sets.	Students were not required to read the textbook, CLRS, but many students thought it was useful because it covered most of the lecture materials. Some considered the lecture and recitations notes to be more useful for doing problem sets and tests.	The exams were comprehensive and progressively challenging. Most students thought that the exams tested understanding of the materials well and were graded fairly. However, some thought the time constraints for designing algorithms during the exams were unreasonable.	Subject promises algorithms, does not disappoint.\nI have never learned more in an MIT class.

The class focused on giving its students a taste of all the different applications of electromagnetic theory in technology today. Topics included E&amp;M, waves, optics, and quantum. The class did not use the same theoretical rigor that a physics class would. Students felt that the content was interesting but difficult to fully appreciate due to the pace of the class. Some felt that the range of topics was too broad and some things were not covered in sufficient depth. 	Professor Bulovic\ntopics\nSmall class\nMaxwell's equations + biology	PowerPoint presentations\nlack of detail\n	Most students took the class because they enjoyed 8.02 and wanted exposure to applied E&amp;M. They also wanted a friendly introduction to quantum and waves. 	The problem sets were lengthy and difficult but useful for understanding the content. Most students recommended collaborating or taking advantage of office hours. 	Students found the labs to be interesting and insightful; they reinforced course content well. Everyone who commented on the length of the labs said that they were reasonable. 	Students who responded said that the grading was fair. One student noted that problem sets were graded too slowly.  Problem sets were weighted heavily (20%) but no one complained about that. 	The class notes for the class were the PowerPoint slides from lecture. Most students found them unsatisfactory. On the other hand, students who used the textbook found it to be very helpful.	Students found the quizzes to be thorough but fair. One student noted that they were usually too lengthy. \nThe exams referenced materials from both the problem sets and labs. Students were allowed to create a cheat sheet and were provided with five practice tests to prepare. 	Prof. Bulovic is AWESOME!! I've learned so much about how to think about EE/Physics.	There were three main suggestions. The first was to decrease the reliance on PowerPoint type lectures and do more derivations on the board. The second was to organize the course notes better.

Usefulness\nMaterial\nClarity of lectures\nProf. Verghese	Difficult exams	Most students took this class because they needed a header subject, to meet their requirements. Others took it just for fun, out of interest in the material, especially after some took 6.003.	Problem sets generally played a strong role in students' understanding of the material. Students felt problem sets had the appropriate level of length and difficulty to facilitate learning the class content. Homework problems were generally standard and relevant to both the quiz and material.	There were no labs in this class.	Students thought the grading was generally fair, though some felt exams had a lot of weight in the final grade. Students liked the 0-3 grading scale for the problem sets because it meant that students were not penalized for &quot;silly mistakes&quot;.	The readings were thought to be excellent and extremely helpful for doing problem sets. Students thought the 6.003 textbook was also useful, especially for the first exam.	The quizzes were generally very difficult. While most questions were similar to those on problem sets, there were some unexpected problems as well as a lot of trick questions. Though challenging, students still thought the quizzes were fair. Doing well on the problem sets reflected directly on how well prepared students were for the quizzes.	Along with 6.003 and 18.06, I count it among the few classes that have drastically changed the way I look at the world.\n\nWhile previous complaints have focused on its theoretical nature, this class presents the necessary foundations for the application which would be taught in followup classes. In terms of the theory, the class is well taught and immensely interesting.\n\nThis class is 6.003 on crack, I mean, with noise. In other words, you'll be learning how to create optimal systems to process noisy signals.\n\nWe learned about various subjects in Comm, Control and Signal Processing. However, there is no sense of mastery or completion in any of them. \n\nThe subject's strong points are generality and derivability. I don't think it has any weak points. \n\nI expected the class to be 6.003 part 2, but really this class is different than just an advanced 6.003. There is much more focus on random signals and less on advanced techniques.	Students generally thought the class was well taught.

The lectures focused on theory but were balanced out by the application work in the project, which was nothing less than building up a compiler from scratch.

Building a compiler\nRinard\nCompilers	Slow grading\nBad group for semester-long assignment	Students who took this class did so mostly because they needed a lab, an AUS, or were interested in compilers, the fundamentals of language function and design. Some people also took it because their friends were taking it, and they were excited to form a group.	This class had no problem sets.	This class consisted of one semester-long lab that piece-by-piece pushed students to write an entire compiler from scratch.  The labs reinforced the theory taught in lecture and pushed students' abilities to make strong design decisions and to work hard on a long, large project.  The construction of the compiler was left almost entirely to the students with little to no skeleton code or guidance provided by the TAs.	The grading in this class was poor, with slow feedback and many students were unable to gauge how they stood in the class.	Recommended (but not required) texts were useful to the students, or at least those who used them.  Course notes consisted of lecture slides, which were used by most students and were in general well-liked.	Exams sometimes strayed too far towards the theory, and some students found them irrelevant to the focus of the class, but in general students managed the three open-book exams without difficulty.

It covers the basics of probability, with great emphasis on modeling and problem solving in probabilistic systems. The recitations and tutorials are important in developing the ability to solve problems effectively. The skills we impart are crucial to engineering students who need to deal with uncertainty in different guises. We assume only knowledge of 18.01, 18.02, but try to make connections to other subjects commonly taken by our students. Students can collaborate on assignments as long as they disclose the collaboration. 	This class focused on probability and also taught a bit of statistics.  After moving slowly at the beginning and covering a small amount of the theory behind probability at each step, it threw at students a ton of practice problems and applications which could at times be difficult.  Students found the material interesting and appreciated the intuition behind probabilistic formulas that was conveyed by the end of the course.	Textbook\nLearning probability	Hard tests\nTutorials	Many students took this class because it was required for 6-1 or to help fulfill their M-Eng requirement, and a few took it because a solid knowledge of probability is required in many fields.	Simple math errors on problem sets sometimes resulted in disproportionate drops in individual problem set grades, but students in general found the problem sets to be a good length and difficulty and the very best way to learn the class material.  They were not heavily weighted in calculation of the final grade, and covered material presented in the book and in lecture.	This class did not have labs.	The grading in this class emphasized exams, which were heavily curved due to their difficulty, which made grade cut-offs hard to predict.  Students regarded the policies as fair.

This class was a survey of mathematical concepts relevant to various aspects of computer science, including number theory, graph theory, counting, probability, random variables, induction, and proofs.  It was not a linear build-up of concepts in the same sense as algebra, calculus, or even differential equations.  The class was a bit skewed towards theory, but was extremely useful to anyone interested in programming.  Topics were covered at a shallow level because of the speed of the course, but that didn't mean there weren't interesting problems to be solved!	Collaboration\nProfessor Meyer\nTopics\nCourse notes\nEasy-going atmosphere	TEAL\nSometimes fast-paced	Many students took this class because it was required for 6-3, and was a prerequisite for later classes in computer science.	Students found the problem sets challenging, sometimes a bit too long, but usually useful for understanding.  Collaboration was a must for most students, especially when it came to the one really hard problem each week.	This class did not have labs.	TEAL came with its unusual aspects of grading (attendance is required).  The grading was fair but harsh on partial credit, and while more than a third of the class got A's, the high averages shocked some people with lower grades than they expected.	This class threw a barrage of important readings at students between class notes and the textbook.  Students commented that reading the notes before class helped immensely in following the lectures and using the notes and textbook as a reference during problem sets was a must.  Reading all the course notes helped some students in all aspects of the class.\n\nStudents noticed a few errors in the text - beware!	Students found the mini-quizzes pretty much what they expected, but still fairly difficult.  The full-length quizzes were too long for the allotted time.\n\nIn general students' reactions to the assessments in this class were varied.

Each week, a laboratory assignment is offered to investigate the material studied in 6.002 the week before. Some of the lab work is offered as a design challenge. Ideally, the subject should involve one hour of work outside the lab, and two hours of work inside the lab per week.\n	This class was an extension to 6.002 and provided lab experience where students learned to build and measure various kinds of simple circuits.

The lab notebook was graded and checked off. Students found that the grading was fair in this aspect.	The readings were the same as the readings for 6.002.	There were no quizzes in this class, although the quiz grade came from the quiz and final exam average in 6.002.

Students learned a lot about basic solid-state electronic devices, especially transistors, and the class was very focused on the application of these devices. In addition to the application, the class also taught a small number of theoretical concepts.

The problems sets were useful for understanding the material, but because they were much more open ended than typical problem sets, students felt that it would have been helpful to have TAs to discuss the problems with. The professor had office hours, but more office hours a week would have been helpful for completing the problem sets.	There were three labs (one of them was optional) where simple devices were simulated using commercial software. These labs were not too challenging, but not too useful for learning the material either. Although these labs were not too interesting, they were helpful in understanding how the course material could be applied outside the classroom.	The grading in this class was very fair and generous, although the grading for the exams was somewhat ambiguous.	There was no course textbook, but readings were given once a week. Most of these readings were extremely helpful for understanding the material, although some were not as helpful. The readings were located in different sources, some of which were available at the MIT Library.	The exams for this class were very long and difficult, and the problem sets were not representative of the types of questions that appeared on the exams. Doing well on the exams required a thorough understanding of the material as well as good intuition, as opposed to having the procedures memorized. The exams also had very time-consuming numerical calculations. Although the exams were difficult, they were graded generously.		It would have been very helpful to have a single set of course notes for this class. The readings for the class were spread out over several sources, and the different notations used in the sources were confusing for learning the material.

The lecturer (Bertsekas)provided a lot of intuition for the subject and the lectures were very organized. The second half of the course dealt with examples that were not treated by the classical theory of the first half. This was a refreshing addition.

They said that this class was a must for anyone interested in optimization or real analysis. 	Most students who responded felt the application based programming problems were helpful for understanding the use of various algorithms, and that it was unnecessary to collaborate on most of the computational assignments although they were time consuming. Some students felt that there was much focus on tricks, whereas others that they helped you understand the material intuitively. 	There were no labs for this class.	Most students thought the grading was fair.	Some students felt the textbook and lecture notes for the first half of the course were great, but others found the coverage too broad and the main points hard to glean from the readings. Students used outside sources to accompany their studying, especially during the second half when the material covered was newer. 	Most students thought the quizzes were fair and correlated well with the material covered throughout the course. Some thought the exams were a bit long and should have taken two hours instead of the 1.5 allotted, and some did not like the true/false questions.		It would be better to have more applications and examples, specifically on problem sets or perhaps in the form of a final project.

The emphasis is on combining mathematics with intuition in such a way that students can easily apply the results to their own research topics.   There are many toy examples drawn from a wide variety of application areas, but the emphasis is on understanding the connections and underlying probabilistic structure of the processes.  Students are encouraged to work together on the exercises with an emphasis on questioning and insight rather than manipulating equations. 	This class taught concepts fundamental for communications, operations research, queueing, and scheduling. The class was very theory based, but touched on applications as well.

The course is organized into two parts.  The first part covers nonlinear effects in wave propagation and EM wave theory which is applied to the design of nonlinear optical devices; the second part covers the quantum theory of nonlinear interaction of light and matter.  \n\nAmong the topics covered are wave propagation in anisotropic media, electro-optic modulators, harmonic, sum and difference frequency generation, parametric oscillators, nonlinearities in optical fibers, solitons, and the nonlinear interaction of light and matter, perturbation theory, density matrix theory, laser gain, laser operation and spectroscopy. \n\nThe course is intended for students who are performing research in optics, spectroscopy, photonics, optical devices, and optical communication systems.  The objective of the course is to give students the necessary foundation for performing independent research in these areas.  The course is intended for real world research.  \n\nThe course text consists of notes on nonlinear optics written by Prof. E.P. Ippen.  There are also recommended texts and class handouts.  \n\nThe course requirements consist of 6 problems sets, one quiz and a term paper.  Problem sets are assigned every two weeks.  (note that the time spent per problem set should therefore be divided by two in order to calculate the time spent per week on homework).  \n\nThe term paper is chosen by the students on a topic of their choice related to their research or independent interest and is an opportunity to learn more detail about a specific topic.  \n\nEach member of the class was also asked to participate in grading one of the problem sets and to create one problem and its solution on material covered in class.  The purpose of this was to make students more familiar with the material from different perspectives and also to enable full grading of the sets which would not be possible otherwise.  This also provides greater flexibility in case students are busy with conferences or other responsibilities.  Students are not required to do the problem set for which they are grading.  Therefore, only 5 problem sets are actually required for the course.  \n	The course provided a thorough coverage of the EM theory behind nonlinear optics. Students thought that Professor Fujimoto could have covered more material, however, instead of discussing topics unrelated to optics such as politics and time-management. In particular, the curriculum lacked modern applications of nonlinear optics.\n\nThis class required a considerable time commitment for the problem sets and the final paper. Those seeking additional resources outside of lectures found it difficult to meet with Fujimoto and instead relied on the excellent TA office hours.	Research discussions\nPhilosophical talks	Poor coverage\nTime consuming	Students took the class because they were pursuing research in the field of lasers and optics, or just wanted to learn about nonlinear optics.	There were six problem sets in the term. Students found them to be long and time consuming, but very helpful in learning the concepts.	No comments.	Grading was based on a curve. Students thoughts on the fairness of the grading were mixed, some stating that the grading was fair and others saying it was quite hard to be better than other students in the curve to get a good grade in the class.	No comments.	There was a midterm quiz. Students thought the quiz covered the concepts and helped them learn the material. 	Nonlinear optics is awesome.

Students appreciated that they integrated nicely with the lectures and exams.	The design project was an interesting and comprehensive application of the skills and analytical techniques built up in the class. In general, students thought it was reasonable in length and difficulty.	Students found that grading was fair, but had mixed opinons about the high weighting (40%) of problem sets.	Students found the course notes to be fantastic and very well prepared. Students thought the textbook was occasionally useful as a learning aid, but overpriced and better as a reference book.	Students thought that the exams were very reasonable tests of the course material, though on the easy side. They appreciated that they were given unlimited time on the exams, as well as ice cream. 	[6.334] is definitely the most enjoyable, lowest stress testing environment I've experienced at MIT.\nThe buck converter design project done at the end of the course is the icing on the cake.

In addition, students who wished to apply modern signal processing tools to other research areas benefitted from seeing a variety of signal representations and learning about their relative merits.\n\nThe course had a midterm exam, but students were evaluated primarily on the quality of a research project.  Students were prepared to put significant effort into the project; the staff was willing to provide guidance and feedback throughout the semester.

The textbook was very useful, although the class moved quickly through the reading. 	The midterm was at about the same difficulty level as the problem sets. Studying from previous tests was recommended. 	By studying the underlying structure, many algorithms and tools used in engineering became 'more natural' and easier to use and understand.

The first half of the course consisted of lectures and a series of lab assignments designed to prepare students for the second half of the course, where students formed small teams to design and implement complex digital systems involving FPGAs.\nThe course was not a required subject but could be taken to fulfill a TQE requirement for doctoral students. Students took this class in order to get hands-on practical experience building digital systems on FPGAs. We hope that students learned that it is possible to dramatically elevate the level of digital design borrowing and many advanced concepts from software design. Students were encouraged to collaborate in the project phase but had to do the preceding labs individually.\nIn the future we expect the final projects will be even more ambitious as more prepackaged IP blocks become available and the FPGA platforms mature.\n	The subject content was well balanced between theory and application. The course structure consisted of lectures and six labs for the first half of the semester and a large design project for the second half. Students commented on the high quality of teaching in this class. \n\nThis class provided an introduction to Bluespec SystemVerilog and taught high-level principles of digital design.

It covers the basics of probability, with great emphasis on modeling and problem solving in probabilistic systems. The recitations and tutorials are important in developing the ability to solve problems effectively. The skills we impart are crucial to engineering students who need to deal with uncertainty in different guises. We assume only knowledge of 18.01, 18.02, but try to make connections to other subjects commonly taken by our students. Students can collaborate  on assignments as long as they disclose the collaboration. 	Despite the course name, students felt that this class was actually quite theoretical. It covered a wide variety of topics in probability, but gave few opportunities to use the knowledge in an applied way. Furthermore, students expressed frustration with the pace at which the course moved. The amount of material being covered and the difficulty of the problem sets left students without the deep understanding of probability they had hoped to gain. This class meets with 6.041 (undergrad version).	Clear Lectures\nCapable TAs	Hard exams\nHard homework\nOverwhelming material\n\n	Students mostly took this class to meet requirements. If you want to take this class and have some flexibility in your schedule, it is probably better to do so during an otherwise easy semester.	The problem sets consisted of undergraduate problems and graduate problems. The undergraduate problems were as doable and educational as the graduate problems were tedious, time-consuming, and unhelpful. Students suggested collaboration as a way to tackle the long and challenging problem sets. The staff chose only a few of the problems from each homework to grade.	There were no labs for this class.	The course grades seemed to fall in something like a bimodal distribution, with students having prior experience with probability outperforming those without. Students were frustrated with how much of the final grade was based on exams.	The required textbook was useful, especially when it came time to do the problem sets.	Time was the largest issue with the exams.  Students often felt that there were far too many problems to solve in the allotted time. Because of the weight of the exams in final grade (90%), it was important to spend ample amounts of time reviewing the material and doing practice problems to become faster with the material. Unfortunately, the problems on the exams were not what the students had expected based on the problem sets and the recitation material.		Students would like to see the course spend more time on less material.

However, students who had been expecting a theoretical class were very satisfied with the thoroughness with which the material was covered.	Course notes\nEverything about Professor Golland	LONG problem sets\nMorning Lectures	Most students took this course to learn more about information theory or inference to apply to their own research, but there were also several students who took it because it sounded interesting.	The problem sets for this course were time consuming and challenging. But don't let this stop you from taking this course. Many students enjoyed the problem sets, despite the long hours they had to put in. The problem sets were very relevant to the course material, extremely useful for learning, and also fairly interesting.\nBe sure to note that some students, in contrast, felt that the problem sets were unnecessarily long and tedious. Either way, collaboration and office hours seemed to be a must for doing the problem sets well.	There were no labs for this class.	The final grade in the class was heavily weighted towards the exams: approximately 45% from the final, 40% from the midterm and only 15% from the problem sets. While this was the initial rough breakdown, if a student did better on the final than the midterm, the grade on the final would be counted for the whole 85%, and the midterm grade would be ignored.\nStudents were generally satisfied with the grading of the course, but a few students complained about the problem set grading. Only two questions would be graded on each problem set, and often the comments left by the grader were sparse and unhelpful.	There was no textbook for this course, but the lecture notes were excellent. Students who needed or wanted more resources for the material found the cited textbooks and browsing the internet pretty useful as well.	This course had two exams: one midterm, and one final, both three hours long. Both exams were very challenging, and to many students felt like a race against the clock. In addition to the time issue, the trickiness of the questions presented a challenge to many students. The exams had three questions each, and at least two out of three of those questions could be counted on to require a very thorough understanding of the course material. The questions often went beyond what had been seen in class. Some students found this unfair, but others enjoyed the challenge and found the questions interesting, especially on the final.	The lecture notes were great and an extraordinary resource, exactly relevant to what was going on in the course and a great complement to the lectures.	Overall, students wanted to see more concrete examples and applications of the material covered in class.

Professor's anecdotes	No problem set solutions	The primary motivation that students had for taking this class was personal interest in information theory.	The problem sets were interesting and helpful, but the fact that they were not graded was a drawback. The course staff merely checked that they were turned in, but no feedback or solutions were provided. This made it necessary for some students to go to office hours to make sure they were understanding the material.	There were no labs for this class.	Students found the grading policy to be unclear in this course. According to the syllabus, the breakdown was 30% for each of two quizzes, and then 30% for the project, and 10% for the problem sets. However, the professor decided not to assign a project. In the end, it seemed like the grades were assigned in a fairly subjective fashion.	This class had no required textbook, but students found that the reading the lecture notes, especially when working on tough proofs, made the work much more doable.	The quizzes for this class were interesting and challenging. They required an understanding of the course material and not too much memorization.

The course includes: Review of Maxwell's equations, light propagation, and reflection from dielectric and multilayer structures.  Interference, interferometers, filters, optical systems.  Scalar Fresnel and Fraunhoffer diffraction theory.  Propagation of Gaussian beams and laser resonator design.  Optical waveguides and optical fibers.  Optical waveguide devices. \n\nThe objective of this course is to train students in fundamental concepts and techniques which would be necessary for real world research.  This course is essential for anyone who will be performing research, engineering and development in optics, photonic systems and devices, lasers, spectroscopy or optical imaging.  However, the course may be too rigorous for students interested in a low level survey course.  \n\nGrading is based on 10 problem sets, 2 quizzes and a final examination.  The problem sets have a balance of traditional problems, applied design problems and problems that teach real world research methods.  Students can volunteer to do &amp;amp;amp;amp;quot;community service&amp;amp;amp;amp;quot; instead of one of the problem sets, so only 9 problem sets are required.  Grading for the course is liberal, the main point of the exercises is to learn the material.  \n\nThis evaluation asks for the number of hours spent on homework. Please note that many of the problem sets were given every 1-1/2 weeks. Therefore, please be sure to give the time spent per week (not per problem set).\n\nThe text for the course is Waves and Fields in Optoelectronics by H. A. Haus.  Material from other texts and references is also used.  Class handouts are provided.  \n\nCollaboration on problem sets is permitted, but use of bibles is not allowed and is considered cheating.\n	This was a fundamental course in optics and photonics. It was extremely hard and time consuming.	Incredible learning	Problem sets\nTime consuming\nDifficult	Most people took this class because it was highly related to their research.	Most people said the problem sets were incredibly hard, and too much work/time. Students highly advised collaboration.	N/A	Problem sets were self-graded, and the curve was set so that about half of the students got A's and half get B's.	Students claimed that the textbook was written by a genius, for geniuses only. It was very difficult to grasp, but that it was also rewarding to feel that you actually reached the level of the book by the end. \n	Not enough comments for summary	I was one of those students who did not have much background in the area, and the class did not provide sufficient review material.\n\nIt's highly relevant to my research. DO NOT take this class if you are not working in optics. You will be miserable for no good reason.	Most people said the problem sets need to be shorter and need to increase understanding. The office hours needed to be conducted in a better fashion.		f	f	CTL	12	\N	\N	\N	Not enough comments for summary

Many problems relate to physical processes, devices, and models. The end of the course focuses on the full set of Maxwell's equations to treat electromagnetic waves.\n\nWhy should students take this particular elective? This course provides an advanced treatment of electromagnetism and mathematics which students can apply to their own research interests.\n\nWho should take this subject? All students who have interests in electromagnetism and mathematics as well as those students who need to have an advanced understanding of electromagnetism for their thesis research.\n\nWhat is your teaching philosophy? Teaching by solving many problems. Important concepts are the use of superposition and satisfying boundary conditions.\n\nWhat is the collaboration policy? Most problems, lecture materials, and textbooks are on line on OpenCourseware for 6.641. Students are free to collaborate with each other as long as every student does their own thinking and not just copying.\n\nThis course is taught every spring term and will be taught essentially the same as this term.\n\nMarkus Zahn	This course focused on the mathematics and theory behind principles of electromagnetism. Students felt they became more comfortable with basic EM concepts like solving for electric and magnetic fields and forces in various geometries, although some thought the curriculum progressed too slowly and the class did not cover many advanced topics.\n\nMost believed a thorough knowledge of calculus and differential equations were crucial for understanding the multitudes of mathematical equations presented in the class. While Professor Zahn presented a lot of mathematics in his lectures, he also gave insightful demonstrations and examples.\n\n	Professor Zahn\nDemos	Math\nLong lectures	Students took the class because they were interested in electromagnetism and wanted a deeper understanding of problem solving in E&amp;M and its applications to research.	Problem sets were optional and ungraded, and solutions were available on MIT OpenCourseWare. Students found the problems to be very challenging. Those that were motivated to complete the problem sets found them useful practice for the exams and helpful for learning the material.	There were no labs for this class.	Grading was weighted 50% for the midterm exam and 50% for the final. In particular, problem sets were not graded. Students felt grading was fair.	The textbook was Zahn's own, and was freely available on MIT OpenCourseWare. Most students did not use it, as they found it hard to follow and unrelated to the topics covered in class. Lecture notes were also available on OCW, although students also found the notes to be filled with equations and more useful as a reference to be paired with attending lectures than for self-study.	There was a midterm exam and final exam. Students found the midterm to be straightforward and based on the concepts covered in the lectures and problem sets. The difficulty of the midterm was comparable to the difficulty of the problem sets. Review problems given in class or old quiz problems gave adequate preparation for the actual exam. 	A+++ LECTURER!! I WOULD LEARN FROM AGAIN!!!!	Students suggested that Zahn double-check his example problems before giving them in lectures so that math mistakes could be avoided. Some also felt that less focus in the lectures could be put on algebra, and more on concepts and demonstrations.		f	f	OEE	12	0	\N	\N	Students thought there were clear objectives that were followed in the class.

Emerging field\nCombination of physics and engineering	Time consuming\nDifficult\nPoor alignment of due dates	Interest in nanoelectronics	Problem sets were the main source of work for this class, and were considered difficult enough to require collaboration.  The material tested by the problem sets was an extension of what was covered in lecture.  Overall they were useful for learning the material.	The labs were mainly simulation projects.  They were lengthy assignments that covered a large amount of material.  Projects spanned multiple other assignments, such as problem sets and tests, so weeks with overlap required a large time commitment for this one class.  Students identified that while somewhat tedious, the repetition in the labs helped understand and remember the material better.	Grading during the class was very ambiguous, with few indications given to students about how they were performing relative to the rest of the class/expectations.	The only readings available were the course notes, which sometimes made it difficult to complete problems on problem sets.  Web resources were few due to the new and changing nature of the field.

It addressed the current state of the field of nanoelectronics as well as the direction in which the field is headed.  There were mixed feelings about how much detail was covered.  The consensus was that the class was heavy on theory and that there were many assumptions made during derivations of equations.  Some felt that the methods were very specialized and would not help solve many problems outside of the class.	Final Project\nBaldo\nTransistors\nUnderstanding limits of computation	Inconsistant office hours\nLack of depth of content\nLengthy simulation projects	Some students took this class specifically for (easy?) Grad-H credit.  Most students expressed an interest in the field of nanoelectronics, as well as in the future of electronics in general.  Interest is key because it helps motivate the completion of the large workload.	The problems sets served as a good way to test the students' understanding of the material taught in lecture and in the readings.  The questions ranged from easy (answers found in readings) to difficult, prompting many students to recommend collaboration.  	Most students felt that the labs all took a long time, made worse by the fact that there were other assignments pending during the lab.  The lab projects were programming- and simulation-based.  The students claimed that they understood the material better after completing the labs, and also appreciated the clever demonstrations of real world effects.	Half of the students felt that the grading was fair, and others thought more weight should have been placed on the problem sets to motivate them to complete them properly.  One student said the policy felt like &quot;I'll give anyone who shows me they understand the material an A.&quot;	The textbook was vital to understanding the course material, and the best part: It's Free!  Professor Baldo supplied the students with a PDF version at the start of the semester.  The content in the book followed the course material well, and was vital to answering questions on problem sets.	The exam was fair and was heavily based on homework problems.  The main complaint was that it was fairly time-constrained, which made it beneficial to have memorized formulas.	A fast track towards understanding what can be done at the nanoscale in electronics.	Some students had the sentiment that the class moved a little slow, saying that it felt like more of an undergrad class.  It should be noted that this class is taught with 6.701, which is the undergrad equivalent.  There were also requests for a hard copy of the textbook, more time on the midterm exam, and possibly using the various projects as a substitute for the final, given the length of the assignments.	http://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/6/sp11/6.701/	f	f	MDN	12	0	\N	\N	The class followed the syllabus well, and made its objectives clear from the start.

The upside was that most students agreed that projects really helped further the understanding of the material, but for some, the time spent focused on the projects detracted from what could have been spent on learning new material.	Students all agreed that grading was extremely fair and that anyone who showed an understanding of the material could earn an A.	In general, the notes and text books were useful and helpful - but oftentimes students consulted outside textbooks to fully understand the material due to the complexity of the subject.  	Students complained that given the difficult and time consuming final project, having a final exam (the only assessment in the class) may have been excessive.

This subject presents an introduction to this broad field, using examples and design projects drawn from real-word MEMS applications. Lectures during the first 2/3 of the term will cover microfabrication technologies and process flow development, material properties, structural behavior, piezoresistive and capacitive sensing, electrostatic actuation, damping, amplifiers, noise, and feedback systems. Student teams will design a microsystem (sensors/actuators, electronics, and feedback) to meet a set of specifications (sensitivity, frequency response, linearity) using a realistic microfabrication process. Modeling and simulation in the design process is emphasized. Along the way, student exercises will develop skills in locating suitable information from libraries and electronic archives, visualization of structures created with microfabrication process sequences, creation of low-order dynamical device models, and insertion of those models into the simulation of a complete electronic measurement circuit. Prior fabrication experience is desirable. This subject carries 4 Engineering Design Points toward the EECS B.S. and M.Eng. requirements.

This course covers the design, implementation, and evaluation of intelligent multi-modal user interfaces built on those technologies.  It works from a combination of papers from the original literature and hands-on exercises, familiarizing students with the basic technologies for handling pen-based, vision, speech, and other unconventional forms of interaction, and enabling them to explore architectures for combining modalities in a variety of ways.\n \nThere are substantial readings from original literature that go with each lecture. The course is project-based, with several smaller, structured projects, and a larger term project of the student's own design and selection. Familiarity with Matlab is a significant advantage on the projects.\n\nSmaller projects are to be done independently; students can work in pairs on the term project, but are expected to submit independently written term papers.\n\nThe course is a natural follow-on to courses on programming and on human-computer interaction, and will equip students with the skills to tackle a variety of intriguing research problems (e.g., for an MS, MEng, or PhD) in this and related areas. It is well suited to advanced undergrads and graduate students.\n\n	6.835 was a primarily literature-based overview of the past 30 years of work in intelligent multimodal user interfaces.  It focused on systems allowing human-computer interaction through methods beyond a keyboard and mouse, often relying on classification and learning techniques.  The course encompassed theory and application in many common interface modalities, including handwriting, gestures, facial recognition, and speech systems, as well as combinations thereof.  Students wrote that it provided a comprehensive and well-structured survey of the field, and was also successful in conveying the subtleties of effective multimodal user interface design.\n	Randy Davis\nContemporary research\nEntertaining, coherent lectures\nFun projects\nGuest speakers\nTom Ouyang\n	9:30am class\nTwice-weekly write-ups\nHarsh grading policy\n	Students primarily took this subject due to a prior interest in UI design, human-computer interaction, and to a lesser extent the intersection of these fields with artificial intelligence.  Many students were very enthusiastic about these interests, and some were pursuing or planned to pursue MEng degrees in the area.  The grad-H designation of the class was also a significant motivation.\n\n\n	Papers and associated reading questions were assigned at every class, with responses to the reading questions due at the beginning of the next lecture.  Students noted that a very large amount of reading was required and that learning to skim effectively was critical to stay on top of the class.  However, they felt that the readings were very effective in obtaining an understanding of the course material and related design decisions, as well as an awareness of current and historical research in the field.\n	The three mini-projects consisted of Matlab exercises demonstrating the mechanics of systems discussed in class, and students generally found them fulfilling and useful in learning how to apply the material.  However, the instructions were sometimes not detailed enough.  Students were given ten days per mini-project, from the release time to the due date.  They advised starting early, both because unexpected delays could arise, and because in retrospect it had been necessary to score nearly 100 percent on each mini-project in order to get an A in the course.  This could be done by ensuring perfect functionality before submitting a given mini-project, but it was unclear from reviews whether that could be easily checked.\n\nThe final project was open-ended, and students found it very interesting and satisfying.  However, they strongly cautioned against procrastinating, since implementation and write-ups could be extremely time-consuming.  This was especially true if any unusual hardware was involved.\n	Students aware of the grading policy when they wrote their reviews considered it to be opaque and extremely unfair.  The grading policy and cutoffs were not released until the end of the semester, aside from a note that grades would be based primarily on assignments and projects.  They had not even been released at the time that most reviews were written: regarding the policy, one student wrote &quot;[I] don't know yet, but all the labs got really good grades. It seemed like everyone got above a 90. Haven't seen the final project or final grades yet.&quot;\n\nIn reality, the course was strictly curved and B-centered; the absolute numbers were meaningless and anything less than 94% on the projects was a C.  Getting an A required scoring 97% or better.  Many students who scored in the mid-90s, which would be an A or A+ in almost any other class at MIT, received Bs and even Cs instead.  Students were not aware of any of this until they received their final grades.\n	The course readings, as noted above, consisted of papers selected from the primary literature.  On average, one paper was assigned per class.  The papers were often lengthy, and students recommended learning to skim effectively in order to avoid falling behind.\n\n	There were no quizzes for this class.		To the instructor, students suggested having slightly fewer readings and more application-based projects, as well as perhaps starting the class later in the day.  (It began at 9:30am.)  Others requested covering more background on some of the machine learning techniques that the class relied on, or at least providing a tutorial paper.  Lecture notes were apparently not posted until the last week of class, which made it more difficult to integrate material into the final project efficiently.  Finally, there were demands for greater clarity regarding the grading policy before the end of the semester.\n\nNo suggestions were made to prospective students.\n	http://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/6/sp11/6.835/index.html	f	f	HCI	12	6	\N	\N	Material objectives were clear from the beginning of the term, and were met effectively.

Apart from the time-intensive labs, there were two readings a week from current literature. The individual laboratory assignments culminated in the construction of a fault-tolerant and scalable network file system.\n  \nStudents thought that there was a good balance between theory and application, but the majority of the learning and mastery came from hours spent completing the labs.  The labs also constituted 45% of the class grade, so they were extremely important in terms of the class.\n\nThe content drew many of the students to take the class, but it seemed that an interest in the material was a must. If you were uninterested Professor Morris did an excellent job of relating the importance of distributed systems, and many thought he was the best part of the class.	Professor Morris	Labs	Many students took this class because they had to pass their technical qualifying exam (TQE).  It also brought in those who had large interest in distributed systems.	While there were two papers to be read each week with a reading question for each, some students were frustrated that the correct answers for the reading questions were never provided.	The labs were the main tool for learning in this class.  They were considered on average long and hard, but if you were able to complete the labs, you would have a good mastery of the material.	Labs, which were a large portion of the grade, were graded by automated tests.  If your implementation passed all the tests, it received a 100.  There was also 72 hours of &quot;late time&quot; that could be split up however a student desired.	There was no textbook for this class, but lecture notes were provided by Professor Morris.  Students found the lecture notes to be helpful for learning the lecture material but not helpful when it came to labs.	The quizzes were more focused on the readings done in class and less on the material in the labs.  They were generally considered easy compared to the rest of the class.		The labs could have used more documentation than was provided.  This was especially true for lab 7, where a number of students felt was much longer and more difficult than the other labs.

The final design project was the heart of the course and where a great deal of the learning happened.  The grading distribution on different parts of the project didn't make sense though. Parts that required one hour were worth the same as those that required weeks of coding. 	There were no large exams.  The class was a design course and the grading followed that with a large portion of the grade being the design project.	There was no textbook for the class, but lecture slides were posted online before class and they covered the material well.	There were nanoquizzes at the beginning of every lecture.

Professor Tedrake\nRobots	Problem sets	Many students were interested in robotics and control theory. They wanted a broad introduction to &quot;real&quot; nonlinear, underactuated control theory, and this class was perfect.	The problem sets usually required students to fill in implementations of the techniques described in class using MATLAB. Frameworks were provided for the algorithms, and they had to fill in some part of the dynamics and costs functions. Collaboration was helpful in figuring out the code.

Karger's lectures	Problem sets	The usage of randomness is a very different sort of approach than the deterministic style that is often used to design and construct algorithms. Students sought to expand their understanding of the practical uses of randomness and to add another skill to their algorithms repertoire.	The problem sets were difficult and very time-consuming, and occasionally marred by badly-written questions. However, most of the questions were educational and interesting, requiring both a solid understanding of the material and significant thought in order to complete. The &quot;collaboration-prohibited&quot; questions tended to be easier than there rest, for which collaboration was extremely valuable.	There were no labs for this class.	Problem sets for the class were graded by the students themselves, with each student grading a particular problem.

Poor organization	The topic of computer security is relatively underrepresented is most CS courses, and as such many students were intrigued by the material which this course aimed to cover. The fact that it was taught by Rivest didn't hurt.	The problems sets were often completed in assigned groups of about four, making for a unique work experience which students tended to appreciate. While straightforward and not exceedingly difficult, the problems were very different from the work demonstrated in lecture, and thus required some thought to complete.

The course is taught entirely in recitation format, and consists of a series of activities drawn from various disciplines, especially the performing/theatrical arts, that challenge students to step outside their comfort zones, in order to stretch their speaking abilities.   The course culminates in a research presentation, in which students demonstrate the skills they learned in 6.UAT, augmented by ideas and techniques introduced in 6.977.	This course expanded on three basic areas of speaking skills: storytelling, explaining, and delivery.  The content of the classes was varied, including acting, improvisational games, and practice presentations.  All of these exercises focused on particular aspects of public speaking, or of technical exposition.  The class also gave to presentations two larger audiences: a chalk talk and a conference talk.  The chalk talk was delivered to both a technical and a non-technical audience.

Since students have varying degrees of past experience in these areas, and because we present and build upon basic material, we recognize that some students may find parts of the course obvious, frustrating, and, on occasion, seemingly patronizing. However, no matter the experience level, there is always room for improvement. This is an unusual class in that the course's objective is to provide guidance and feedback as students complete the various assignments (rather than to teach a specific body of technical knowledge). Students get out of the class what they put into these assignments, and we invite them to 1) take the initiative to create customized value for themselves, 2) use the exercises and assignments to try new things, 3) improve their abilities in these important skills, and 4) develop their own personal style. We hope that students take the time to use 6.UAT as an opportunity to experiment and hone their skills -- an activity better done now, in a supportive environment with little consequence, as opposed to later, when mistakes can be professionally costly. The course is continually evolving, and we welcome input and suggestions for improvement. Finally, although not required, it is helpful if students have a thesis project or potential project idea in mind when starting the class.	Even in the realm of computer science, the capacity for effective interpersonal communication is an invaluable skill. This class focused on teaching and improving students' presentation style. The central element of the course was the several peer presentations, including slide preparation, practice, execution, and Q&amp;A.	Tony Eng's lectures	Mandatory attendance	Without exception, students took this class because it was a required element of the Course VI curriculum.

Some took it to become better programmers for personal interest or internships.	Problem sets were time-consuming but helpful in understanding the material. Students felt that the instructions were ambiguous and that office hours were essential in completing problem sets.	There were two team projects, which students felt were fun but time-consuming. Students gained a lot of practical knowledge from the projects, although there was minimal guidance from teaching assistants and grading was subjective.	Some students felt that grading was fair, but the majority of the class felt otherwise. Problem sets were graded by automated tests, and students never received feedback about which tests they failed and why. Additionally, instructors never looked at the code to assign partial credit in case of a failed test. However, students generally thought that the grading breakdown (&gt;=90 A, &gt;=80 B, etc.) was reasonable.	There was no required textbook for this class, but plenty of lecture notes were available online. Some students found the lecture notes essential for reviewing the material and studying for tests, but some found certain sections to be disorganized, too broad, or unnecessary.	Exams were fairly straightforward and taken from lecture material, although students found them hard to study for because there was only one sample quiz.		Students mainly suggested improvements in the grading scheme. They wished that graders would assign partial credit by examining problem set code instead of merely running automated tests.

The problem sets in this class were a mixture of theory questions (prove X) and applications (code Y). The students had mixed feelings about them. Some students found them helpful and a good balance between theory and application. Others thought found the coding problems extremely tedious and not at all helpful in learning the materials. And others found the theory questions far too hard. In general, collaboration was encouraged and most agreed that the problem sets helped to learn the material in one way or another.	There were no labs for this class.	The determination of final grades was not made clear to students. Grading on individual assignments and quizzes seemed fair.

The grade distribution was as follows: the top 40% of the class gets in the A range, next 40% in the B range, and the final 20% spread out between Cs, Ds, and Fs.  Many thought that system was fair but that the problem set and quiz grading was too strict.	There was no required textbook for this class, but Prof. Guttag provided a draft a textbook he was writing, which students found very useful. However, the draft only covered the first half of the class, and students wished they had a more complete resource. Students otherwise recommended finding resources online. There were also lecture notes, which some students found useful.	Most of the students thought that the quizzes were long, difficult, and did a poor job of testing an understanding of the material.  Some said that they didn't feel properly prepared even after going to the review session while others complained that the tests focused on the nuances of python.		A lot of students wanted the class to move slower, especially at the beginning.  They thought more time should be spent teaching basic computer science concepts, as a majority of the students aren't course VI, and that they should maybe even get rid of the section on probability/statistics.

Some also found it beneficial to collaborate with friends. Some thought the grading was a bit harsh on getting the exact numerical answers, but others thought the grading was fair.	Students used LTSpice for their design problem simulation. Most students thought the design project was an excellent way of making sure they understood the materials. Even though some students thought the design problem was not clearly defined, they were able to receive a lot of help from the teaching staffs.

It reinforced material through laboratory assignments, many of which involved programming robots. Students appreciated seeing an overview of both EE and CS. Some students thought the material could have gone more in depth on certain topics, and those who had already focused on one of the Course VI areas were less interested in material from the other areas.	Playing with robots\nLozano-Perez\nOnline tutor	Bad partnerships\nLong labs	Students were interested in exploring electrical engineering and computer science. Many took 6.01 to fulfill requirements; the class is required for Course VI majors, and is a prerequisite for several other classes. 	Students were required to do online tutor problems that acted as preparation for software and design labs. Students found them easy, but strongly recommended starting early. There were also four problem sets which were more time-consuming.	The course had two lab sessions every week; Software Labs lasted 90 minutes and were done individually, while Design Labs lasted 3 hours and were done with a partner. Students found the lab problems interesting and liked the opportunity to run code on robots. Many students felt that the labs were too long; they pointed out that they commonly did not finish during the lab sessions and had to return later. Some students disliked being matched with poor partners, and others reported that lab equipment could be unreliable.	The grading policy was clearly stated and most students thought it was fair. Some argued that the A/B cutoff (90%) was too high.	There was no required text, but there was a complete set of online class notes, which students generally found very useful. The notes read like a textbook, but were tailored specifically for the topics covered in the class. The notes were long, but students did not feel it was necessary to read them cover to cover; rather, many students referred to the notes only when they got stuck or to study for a test. There was also a wiki, which students found useful. Some students thought that the notes were not specific enough, and they found it helpful to refer directly to online Python documentation and other external resources.	There were short nanoquizzes at the beginning of design labs, along with two midterm exams and a final exam. All quizzes were open-book. Reports about quizzes were mixed - some students found them straightforward while others struggled. A few students complained that nanoquizzes had too much time pressure. Arriving to lab on time was important to be able to complete nanoquizzes within the time limit.	You spend half your time figuring out the overly complicated, archaic system and libraries...

While some students found that simple arithmetic errors would influence their grade, the coding sections were generally good as they tended to apply the lecture concepts. Collaboration was key to doing labs in a reasonable amount of time as it is easy to get stuck.	Since labs were considered problem sets, see the problem set comments.	Students generally believe that final grades will be fair. Weighting is evenly spread between tests and problem sets.	Course notes were available for some sections of the class, but they were missing or posted very late for the signals unit. Most students thought the available notes were helpful for understanding the material, for working on problem sets, and for studying for tests. Students very much wanted notes available for every lecture. Most students did not think the slides were a useful study tool in isolation. Some recitation instructors also offered supplementary notes, which students found useful.	The exams differed from the problem sets and were generally much more challenging. Most students thought that they were doable and fair as they really tested a deep understanding of the core concepts.

The subjects include diffusion, osmosis, carrier mediated transport, ion transport, and electrical response of cells (Hodgkin-Huxley model). \n\nThis is a header subject for course 6 students, because this covers the most basic concepts relevant to cellular physiology. It is one of the restricted elective subject for course 20 students, and this course will complement their core curriculum. This course would be building the fundamentals for any biomedical research, and especially useful for students who are interested in neuroscience / engineering. \n\nThis course is intended for juniors and seniors in engineering school, who have previously taken at least one engineering subject at the sophomore level. It involves various engineering mathematical concepts, so some familiarity with those would help students a lot. \n\nThe teach staffs' goals are 1) Teach / reinforce the most fundamental transport concepts 2) Teach / reinforce the scientific communication skills 3) Introduce the fundamentals of neuroscience to the students. Personally, I think the concept of Hodgkin-Huxley model would be very interesting and useful for students to remember for their future career. \n\nCollaboration to solve homework problem is encouraged, but students should note any collaobration in their work. Some of the projects are requiring students to collaborate, and both students in a team will get the same grade in the end. Bibles do exist and some students use them, but relying on bibles entirely is not recommended since it robs the chance for students to struggle with the new concept and learn properly. Historically, students who did their homeworks on their own had performed better on the exams. \n\nThe course content will be mostly stable for a few years to come, but we may introduce some new examples (especially in the area of neuroscience / engineering) in the future.\n	The class provided an overview of biophysics, focusing especially on mass transport through membranes and electrical signal generation across them.  It was a CI-M, but students found the amount of writing reasonable.  Students found the office hours useful for working on problem sets with TAs available.  Some considered the class too qualitative and distant from electrical engineering, however.  It was not a combination of statistical mechanics and biology, but rather an overview of various models for mass transport and cell electrical properties.  The first half of the subject seemed disconnected from the second half.  Students found the class project helpful in better understanding the material.	Office hours\nSquid giant axon lab!\nMathematical underpinnings of 7.01x\nExcellent TAs	Presentation schedule changes\nLess than desirable amount of EE\nSomewhat erratic lab and project grading\n	Most students took this course because they wanted a CI-M and a header, and this class is both.  Many were specifically interested in the biology-related subject matter.  Some just wanted to try something outside of the usual 6-1 material.	The problem sets were useful in learning the material.  Most students considered them well-constructed, thorough, and helpful in preparing for the exams.  Some found them a bit long.  Going to office hours was the most helpful way for many students to work on them.	Students considered the labs useful in learning specific portions of the material, but felt they had focused on fairly specific concepts.  Some commented that they seemed to have been contrived for the CI-M component of the class.  Lab 1 focused on microfluidics.  It was long and some students felt it had been tedious without automated image capture, but others thought it was fun.  Students were concerned, however, that there had been so little feedback or instruction in writing the related paper and giving the presentation, both of which were graded quite harshly.  Lab 2 was overall more useful than lab 1 for most students.  It focused on the Hodgkin-Huxley squid giant axon experiment and many students felt it had given them a better understanding of the HH model.	Grading seemed fair, with the exception of the microfluidics lab.  Students considered the lab 1 grading much too harsh, and felt that the writing staff did not adequately set expectations.  Also, students noted that it had been difficult to get an A because the exam averages were very high.	Most students thought the textbook was excellent; it explained concepts well, and went more in depth than the lectures. Some said that the textbook was key for doing well in the course and understanding the concepts. There were also class notes, which were a useful supplement to lectures, but were hard to understand in isolation.	Most students found the exams reasonable and fair at testing the material.  The averages were high.  The exams were slightly easier than the problem sets.  To do well on them, students recommended not over-analyzing questions.  There were many opportunities for practice before the exams.	Performing simulations and analyzing the HH model significantly deepened my understanding of the material.\n\nThe subject material is NOT a combination of statistical mechanics and biology.  It simply teaches you the different models for transport mechanism and electronic properties of cells.\n\nThe objective was to apply Ohm's law to biology. The class applied Ohm's law to biology. I am confident that it applied Ohm's law to biology.\n\nVoldman is a cool professor and his lecture is lightened by his sometimes cryptic cultural references. And I like his focus on the conceptual understanding of the mathematical equations.\n\nHH lab was very good. Microfluidics lab was tedious and graded way too harshly.\n\nWe were never explicitly told what makes a good paper or presentation. It was left to us to figure that out.\n\nFeedback [from the writing instructor] was often unclear.\n\nI am confused as to why a bioee class is a header, but there is no circuits header for 6-1 besides 6.012 (device physics). I don't feel like I can apply this subject in what I will be doing in the future and would have preferred to take a more relevant course instead.	Students suggested using more quantitative methods and relying less on graphs.  They also wanted more electrical engineering material and practical applications of the subject matter.  Graduate students had longer problem sets, and felt it would have been more useful to have fewer, harder problems.  Students wanted tutorials to be longer since they are key to the class.  Tutorial sessions were the main venue for learning how to solve the problems on the homework assignments and exams.  Students also wished lectures had been less dry and included more problem solving.  They wanted to see better slides, with less copying and pasting from the textbook, or less use of PowerPoint in general.  They also believed that not enough time had been provided for the microfluidics lab (lab 1), and that grading on this lab been too harsh.

Otherwise, this is a must-take class for anyone who needs to master probability theory.\n\nIt focuses on probability and also taught a bit of statistics. After moving slowly at the beginning and covering a small amount of the theory behind probability at each step, it threw at students a ton of practice problems and applications which could at times be difficult. Students found the material interesting and appreciated the intuition behind probabilistic formulas that was conveyed by the end of the course.	Professor Tsitsiklis\nLectures	Exams	Students took this class out of interest, to satisfy undergrad requirements in course 6, 18 and 9, and to fulfill MEng and PhD requirements.	Problem sets were of normal length; challenging, yet doable. Completing the problems sets is highly recommended if you wish to do well on the exams and to master the material.	There were no labs for this class.	Students reported that aside from a tough first exam, the grading in the class was fair, with exams worth more than problem sets.	Students generally found the textbook to be a useful and complete reference for the class. Lecture notes were provided, though they were not as useful as attending lecture.	There were two exams for this class. The first was harder, focused on really testing students' understanding of the course material. The second exam was easier, with fewer questions. Students' preparation varied, but most acknowledged that the problem sets and lectures prepared them for the exams.	Professor Tsitsiklis gives extraordinarily organized, evenly-paced lectures that pack in a lot of information.\n\nThis class gives a solid coverage of discrete/continuous probability tools, random variables, and introduction to inference.

Some people also took the class because it was fun and the material was interesting.	Problem sets were very helpful in learning the material and were generally graded fairly. Collaboration is highly encouraged.	N/A	Students felt the grading policy was fair, and most students received high marks for the class. Problem sets were graded on a good/satisfactory/unsatisfactory scale, which many students felt did not provide enough feedback. Attendance and participation were very important factors in determining final grades.	The textbook was written specifically for 6.042 and was available online. Most students thought it was a great resource; it had sections for all the concepts covered in lecture, it was approachable, it had a good set of example problems, and it was occasionally funny.	Instead of tests, the class had a 15-minute long mini-quiz every week (plus a final exam). Mini-quizzes were generally straightforward and representative of the material covered during the past week. They were much easier than problem sets; however, they could be tricky in that losing only a few points could mean a very low score for that quiz. Students found that the best preparation was to review the in-class problems from the week before.	I really enjoyed learning the material. I came in pretty terrified of theoretical math and proofs (and still am... a little bit) but I did enjoy the topics we covered.	This class is sometimes taught in TEAL format and sometimes taught lecture-style; you should definitely consider which fits your learning style better when deciding which semester to take it!	http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.042/fall11/	f	f	math	12	\N	\N	\N	\N

It is a chance to remember why you came to MIT:  to learn and to build cool systems. The material in this class is relevant for everyone: EECS, ME, Physics, Aero-Astro....\n  \nWe study the design and construction of power electronic circuits and motor drives.  Laboratory exercises include the construction of drive circuit for an electric go-cart, flash strobes, computing power supplies, three-phase inverters for AC motors, and resonant drives for lamp ballasts and induction heating.  We examine basic electric machines including DC, induction, and permanent magnet motors. As a member of this class, you'll complete a sequence of assigned projects, followed by a final project of your choice, emphasizing creativity and uniqueness.\n\nThe overarching goal of this class is to share with you the skills and techniques that designers use to make useful systems that solve problems for people.  These are the skills that will make you successful in an engineering career.  They empower you to see the value of analysis techniques you have learned.   Your experience in this class will teach you to use analytical methods to constrain problems in ways that lead to winning solutions – answers that makes your UROP project successful, that make your thesis work, that make your product a commercial success, that let you stand flat-footed in front of a problem and fight to win.\n\nPower electronic circuits are the backbone of almost every modern convenience.  Automobiles, cell-phones, laptop and desktop computers, television sets, and kitchen appliances, among many other systems, require power electronics circuits to convert electrical energy to a useful form.  \n\nThe creation of a successful power electronic circuit almost always requires more than the application of a set of analytical techniques. The most elegant examples are crafted by engineers who have a rich understanding of how to make trade-offs amongst all the parts of a system, e.g,, thermal, mechanical, electrical, and sometimes software.  For this reason, we make special efforts to expose you to a huge number of demonstrations developed from a wide range of engineering disciplines, and to provide exciting laboratory experiences that let you try the techniques you learn on practical hardware.  \n	The class is very useful to all aspiring electrical engineers: you learn to design and build (and appreciate!) power electronics. Students noted that you should expect to put in a lot of time, but the class is well worth the time commitment.	Labs\nProfessor Leeb	Length of labs	Students took this class out of interest in the material or after hearing how awesome the class is. Others took it to satisfy their department lab requirement.	There were no problem sets for this class.	The labs were long and sometimes excruciating, but were absolutely essential to learning the course material and were very well structured.	Students felt that the grading was fair if you put in the time to do the labs well.	Students thought that the textbook &quot;Practical Electronics for Inventors&quot; was not particularly helpful; it covered general topics in electronics, but did not dive into many of the specifics covered in class. Students universally thought the class notes were amazing and were very important for doing well in the class. However, they were only handed out in lecture and not available online; if a student missed a lecture, he or she had to get the notes from a friend.	There was one quiz at the end of the class, it was open note, and a practice quiz was posted. Most students found the quiz fair and easy to study for.	6.131 is a fantastic class, but to learn a lot you have to work a LOT.\nThe best class offered at MIT.

As this was one of the larger group projects that a student was likely to take part in at MIT, the class placed a lot of emphasis on teamwork and communication. Students regularly gave short presentations to the class, describing their progress on the component of the design for which they were responsible.	Robots!\nA week in Italy	Time constraints	Students universally cited their passion for robotics as their primary motivation for taking this course.	N/A	The class curriculum started with a couple small labs, which seemed a bit slow to some students. Once the design project (the bulk of the course) was underway, most students were satisfied with the availability of resources, such as the robots and the course staff. However, many students acknowledged that the project could require a significant time commitment.	As a high-level group design project, the course did not place much, if any, emphasis on grades. Students were graded almost entirely on effort.	There was no required textbook, but lecture materials and reference manuals were a useful resource.	N/A	I love the way that this class is very open-ended.\n\nMotivation isn't grades but that other pieces of the system are relying on you.	Many students felt that the preparatory labs at the beginning of the course took too much time away from the main project. While these labs were useful, to an extent, in familiarizing students with the sofware framework with which they would be working, they could have been reduced to a single short lab without losing any of this benefit. Some students also felt that the class project would have benefited from set milestones throughout the semester, in order to motivate the project's timely progression.	http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.142/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page	f	f	AI	12	12	\N	\N	In a general sense, the goal of the class was to design and implement a robotic system, as conceived by the students as a group.

Also, it satisfied their TQE, AUS and other requirements. Many took it out of interest in digital signal processing (DSP) and meant to use it as a precursor for other more advanced and specific subjects. 	The students found the problem sets to be very difficult and long, but they were enormously helpful in understanding the material. Many students collaborated. They consisted of a good balance between theory and MATLAB and some students recommended that more feedback would have been useful. The MATLAB problems however were very good and educational. 	There were no labs. 	The grading seemed fair. It was not lenient but fair. It consisted mostly of As and Bs. 	The textbook was found to be very helpful by the students, whereas the class notes were not very helpful.\nProfessor Oppenheim did not really do much math in class, so the textbook was a necessary supplement to lectures.\nThe lectures follow the textbook very closely. Students highly recommended supplementing the reading with lecture attendance and office hours. However students should also keep in mind that the textbook was very analytic and challenging to follow at times. \n	The single midterm exam was a long, tough and tricky endeavor. Students needed to know the material very well to do well on it. 		The students made several suggestions for ways in which the class could be improved in the future. They recommended that the level of the MATLAB problems could be risen, and that they could have been designed to deal with more implementation. There was not enough feedback for the problem sets.

The class also covered MCMC, Kalman/ particle filtering, HMMs, inference on these models, learning models, EM and involved algorithm implementation via MATLAB. It was very useful material for application to real-world problems.\n	Topics covered\nProfessor Wornell's lectures\nApplicable material 	Long problem sets\nProofs\nToo theoretical 	Some students were motivated by relevance to their research. Others were simply interested in the subject, wanted background in their graduate studies, or preparation for their TQE. 	Students found the problem sets to be interesting, however they are not weighted heavily for the final grade. They were hard but didactic and solidified concepts. 	There were no labs.	Generally students found the grading to be fair if not more on the lenient side. 	Lecture and recitation notes were compiled this term for the first time.  The lecture notes were extremely helpful in covering the core material.  The recitation notes also did a great job of filling in some gaps that were left out in lecture.  Both made this class much more manageable.  The text book was the electronic copy of Jordan's &quot;An Introduction to Probabilistic Graphical Models&quot; which was a somewhat rough draft with some sections not yet written.  It was helpful in lending additional insight on the material, but also did not correlate completely with the class.  Another book recommended was Koller and Friedman's &quot;Probabilistic Graphical Models&quot;, which was very dense and theoretical.  It was helpful in learning the material in the early part of the course (theoretical properties of graphs and how they relate the distributions and conditional Independencies.)\nBut the class notes were more than adequate, they were very useful and helped greatly with the problem sets. \nThe class noted were for some one of the best parts of the class. \n\n	Students found the mid-term quiz manageable and a good test of their understanding. Speed was a major plus for the quiz. 	What if we have this situation? Three parents. A tough situation to moralize. -Prof. Wornell\n	Suggestions for future improvement include more applied concepts in class, and current research topics to inspire students. Students also felt that there should be better planning to get the homework material to line up with what is currently being covered. Other suggestions include bi-weekly problem sets, thorough homework grading, easy exercises at the beginning of the problem sets to establish intuition, and more supplementary material. 		f	f	AI	12	\N	\N	\N	The students felt the course objectives were met.

The class followed the book closely and presented the material in a relatively abstract and formal manner.	Textbook\nProfessor Zheng's lecture style	No TA or recitation\nMathematical rigor\n	Students took this class primarily because it was relevant to their research and counted toward the TQE (Technical Qualifying Exam) requirement.  They also found the material useful and engaging in its own right, and recommended it to others interested in the mathematical foundations of communications systems.	The problem sets were relatively infrequent.  Students considered them valuable in learning the material, though they were sometimes not representative of exam content.  Some were rather long, but collaboration was encouraged and there was plenty of time between assignments.  Feedback consisted only of check marks and occasional comments if errors existed.  Solutions were only posted for the first problem set of the semester; many students found this problematic.	There were no labs in this class.	Students were largely unsure how grading worked.  There were delays in getting feedback on the problem sets.  Grading emphasized having concise solutions and avoiding extraneous work.\n	The textbook was very helpful for general understanding. Students warned though that class attendance was a must because exam questions came out on concepts mentioned in class that were not necessarily spelled out in the book. The textbook was also good for dealing with problem set problems. \n\n	The first exam was in class.  Students found it difficult, subtle, and overly time-constrained.  The questions were more difficult than those on the problem sets.  The second exam had a take-home format; students appreciated having more time to think about the problems.\n	Professor Zheng is a fantastic lecturer; Gallager's text is rigorous, clear, and well written; material is engaging, interesting, and interesting. It was wonderful to see truly theoretical math like measure theory play such an important role in engineering application.\n\nExams have subtleties that might be frustrating.\n\nExcellent. A good balance of intuition and mathematical rigor.\n\nGreat content, presented in a logical straightforward fashion.\n\nThe idea of eliminating a TA is admirable, though this cost a lot in terms of feedback on assignments and availability of homework and exam solutions. Perhaps more pain than gain.\n\nMATH AHHHHHHHH	Students were frustrated by the lack of recitations, TAs, or problem set solutions.  They noted that they were often uncertain whether they had done the problem sets correctly.  Feedback on assignments was generally limited to a check mark.  Lectures should have included more examples and spent less time copying derivations from the textbook.

Most students found the grading of the class to be fair. The homeworks were required to pass the class, but were not worth much, while the final was 40% of the grade.	The textbook was filled with extraneous equations and unclear explanations of concepts. Students did not feel that the lecture notes were very useful overall. The lectures themselves however were useful. On the other hand there were students that were satisfied with the textbook and lecture notes. Furthermore, the course did not follow the textbook in sequence and this made for a difficult learning experience for some.  	The quizzes in this class were based on the problem sets, but were slightly easier problems. Students were allowed cheat sheets, and some students felt constrained by time on the exams.

The textbook was good for describing the general concepts and detailed math behind each of the topics, as were the class notes.

Topics relevant to CMOS, bipolar, optoelectronic and other novel device fabrication are discussed, including high k gate dielectrics, gate etching, implant-damage enhanced diffusion, advanced metrology, stress effects on oxidation, SiGe growth and fabrication of process-induced strained Si, and non-planar FET fabrication. The impact of processes and process integration on device characteristics is also discussed.  Focus is on physical understanding, with exposure to concepts used in process modeling and simulation. Students are given the opportunity to use a modern process simulator in the homework assignments and in the Final Project.  \n\nThis subject is not required.  However, it is strongly recommended for anyone considering a career in or related to microelectronics/micro- and nanofabrication, and for graduate students doing research in those areas.  Students interested in integrated optoelectronics, microphotonics, and MEMS will also benefit from the course.\n\nThe course is geared towards graduate students, however it can be taken by advanced undergraduates as well as masters students and Ph.D. candidates.  It is helpful to have exposure 6.152J, but this is a recommendation and is not required (the text is complete enough to take care of background issues).  Students who have been exposed to basic concepts of the MOSFET (e.g. 6.012) will better appreciate the in-class examples on how processing impacts devices.  \n\nThe teaching philosophy for this subject is to combine fundamental physical background with modeling techniques as well as exposure to “practical” aspects.  The textbook by Plummer et al, does a good job of this.  In addition, material from recent conference publications is added to the lectures, to expose students to practical use of the concepts in the course.  Another part of the teaching philosophy in this subject is that students need to gain experience using modern simulation tools in order to better understand how the models work in practice.  Homework assignments emphasize checking the results of simulations against hand calculations, where possible, to make sure that the simulations make sense.  Students are given a chance to practice their public speaking skills by doing a polished oral presentation at the end of the semester (in place of a written report).\n\nStudents learn best in this area by discussing ideas with each other.  Collaboration is allowed and encouraged.\n\nThe syllabus as well as some of the details of the material is updated each time since the field changes rapidly. 	This class covers a wide range of topics regarding fabrication processes involving CMOS and dopant diffusion with an emphasis  on simulation work to demonstrate and apply concepts learned in class.

Problem sets were straightforward and useful for learning concepts presented in class.	Rather than having multiple labs spread out over term, this class had one final research project that most students found to be substantial but reasonable.	Students generally found the grading to be fair.	The text was found to be a bit old.\nStudents managed well enough by using the course notes supplemented with online resources. Although the textbook was dated, it did cover the basics well. \n	This class had one open book and open notes exam that was on par with the difficulty of the problem sets.		Possible improvements for the class include incorporating more current research as well as assigning more open-ended simulation work. In addition, some students felt like they could have benefited from more regular assignments or more exams.		f	f	MDN	12	\N	\N	\N	Students felt like the objectives for the class were clearly laid out and followed almost exactly.

In addition to covering many algorithms, it introduces students to a wide range of design and analysis methods.  Lower bounds and impossibility results are another theme.\n\nStudents who are interested in learning about such algorithms for use in their own work should take the course.  Since distributed systems are ubiquitous, it could also be of interest to any computer science grad student. \n\nThe course is theoretical, and does require students to write careful definitions, theorems, proofs,...\n\nThe main take-away from the course is that it is possible to understand complex distributed systems mathematically.	Some students felt that the problems sets could have been designed to be more insightful, instead of just grindston-ing algorithmic work. A subset of students would have liked more insight into the mathematical models behind the algorithms. Overall the students thought that the content of the course was very comprehensive and well structured.	Lower Bound Proofs\nDistributed Algorithms\nNancy Lynch\nCool Problems \nNo Exam \nNo Final Project\nFormalism for Asynchronous Systems\nChallenging Problem Sets\n\n	Detailed Proofs\nPeer Grading\nToo many problem sets\n	Students took the class because they felt that it would assist them in their research. Furthermore, some hoped it would assist them in their TQE, as well as for experience in writing formal proofs. However, the class material is largely theoretically focused and difficult which means collaboration is strongly recommended. 	Students felt that that problem sets consisted of many grindstone questions that required some insight, but primarily lots of hard work. They found them to be long and tedious. Although the effort was monumental they admitted that those who survived would gain exceptional skills and become competent. Students found use of the Tempo software a bit challenging especially in the beginning. Furthermore, the difficulty of the problem sets peaked around the middle of the term and then tapered off towards the end. Collaboration was essential for keeping the workload manageable. 	There were no labs. 	Problem sets were peer graded, without a rubric. Many students found this led to inconsistent marks, which were often more harsh than necessary. The TA would handle regrade requests, giving students some recourse for unfair marks.	The textbook was written by the professor who taught the course and was found to be very useful by the students. It was though rigorous and detailed and not an easy read. Some students found that the lecture notes were more useful in fathoming the algorithmic concepts because they appreciated the visual aids. They were also a very good learning resource in general and excellent study guides. \nLastly, the course structure did follow the textbook outline very closely. 	There were no exams, something that students noted as a major plus of the course. 		The students had several suggestions for the improvement of the course. Some suggested an alternative to Tempo. Some wanted the course to cover more of the recent material (after 1996) and to have a more even distribution between new and classic material on algorithms. As far as the homework is concerned students felt that at the very least a grading clear rubric should be introduced. Few also complained about an exponential work spike at some point in the course. \n\nMore recommendations included some more algorithms for dynamic graphs, some examples of algorithms for wireless networks, and some randomized algorithms. 		f	f	\N	12	\N	\N	\N	The course objectives were followed quite faithfully according to the students.

Python or Matlab.	86	118	5.20000000000000018	4.70000000000000018	This course covers the fundamental principles of machine learning, including its basis in statistics, decision theory, and computational learning theory.  It describes a variety of formal framings of the problem of learning from data and explores many algorithmic approaches to solving those problems.\n\nI believe that lectures are useful as an introduction to an area, but students really learn by working on problems.  I'm happy for them to work on problems and projects together.\n\nThe prerequisites are important:  facility with probability, and with some aspects of linear algebra, are really crucial to making sense of the material.\n\nThe main message I hope students will take away from this course is that framing a problem (that is, figuring out what the space of possible answers is, how the data relates to those answers, what representations to use) is the key hard problem in machine learning.  Also, that the goal of learning is usually to find a model that will perform well on new data, and that leads to an essential tension between selecting models that perform well on the data in hand and selecting models that are not overly complex.	6.867 provides a broad and rich survey of machine learning framed from the standpoint of statistical inference.  Students found the subject very useful, as well as much more rigorous than 6.034.  However, many students were overwhelmed by the amount of content included.  Some felt that the coverage of material in lecture had been somewhat superficial at times and were concerned about the amount of reading necessary to understand it at a level sufficient for assignments and exams.  Topics sometimes seemed to lack context within a broader organizing framework.  Many students felt the focus was too theoretical, and wished there had been more data-oriented labs and fewer derivations on the assignments.  They strongly recommended having all of the prerequisites complete, as well as reviewing the material from them in advance.  Overall, though, students generally enjoyed learning about the various techniques.  They also considered the final project valuable.\n	Professor Kaelbling's engaging lectures\nMachine learning\nGrading your own problem sets\nCompletely open-ended final project\nHelpful and available TAs\n	Confusing notation\nHighly theoretical assignments\nExtremely long problem sets\nVery difficult first exam\nLots of gritty computation\n	Many students took 6.867 to satisfy a TQE, MEng grad-H, or undergraduate AUS requirement.  Most also had a significant prior interest in the subject matter and considered it important to their research or career aspirations.  Some students considered the class useful for these goals, albeit more theoretical than they had expected.  Others found it very intimidating and less relevant to the applications they had in mind.\n	Most students found the problem sets essential to learning the material, although some considered them too theoretical and derivation-oriented.  The questions were generally not similar to those on exams.  The lengths of the problem sets varied considerably; they could take anywhere from four to 20+ hours and three to 30+ pages of work to complete.  One had 70 questions.  Students strongly recommended collaborating and attending office hours to work on them, as well as budgeting plenty of time for the longer ones.  Most students felt that it was necessary to have a much better understanding of the material than was afforded by lecture in order to do the problem sets; some recommended the Bishop textbook as a reference for completing them.  Some questions were confusingly-worded, and students often spent a significant amount of time determining what some questions were asking for.  However, problem sets became shorter and more comprehensible as the class progressed.  Students graded their own problem sets in recitation while TAs went over the solutions.	There were no regular labs, just a final design project.  Students greatly enjoyed the project and appreciated its highly open-ended nature.  They found the project very valuable in applying the material and pursuing their own research ideas.  However, they lamented the fact that there had not been any other labs.  Students on average spent about 40 hours per person on their projects over a five-week period.  Grading was mostly based on how much implementation work had been done.  A typical project might involve re-implementing and extending a technique from the primary literature, then applying it to an appropriate data set and reporting on the results.  Students reported being stressed that the due date for the project, the last homework assignment, and the final exam occurred within roughly a week and a half of each other.\n	The grading policy was objective, relying on a set of hard cutoffs; there was no explicit curve.  However, most students considered it harsh and felt that such cutoffs were inappropriate in a graduate subject.  &gt;= 85% was an A, &gt;= 75% was a B, &gt;= 65% was a C; below that failed.  The standard weighting was 25% midterm, 30% final, 30% project, and 15% homework.  Students could opt for a 0%-homework scheme that assigned an extra 5% to each of the other categories; this was not beneficial.  There was a significant performance difference between PhDs and undergrads/MEngs.  The average on the first exam was a 68%, with a 20% standard deviation.  The cutoffs had been set before knowing the exam score distributions.  Problem set and project scores compensated somewhat, but since most students received very high scores on these, grades were in practice based almost solely on exam scores.  Exams, in turn, were heavily time-based.\n	The class notes were not that helpful according to some of the students. They were not well organized or well written. On the other hand, the textbook was useful. \nThe class notes were a bit dense, but could be comprehended on their own given sufficient time and study. Sometimes the conflicting notation used in the textbooks was frustrating to students.  \nStudent also felt that the notes on OCW were very helpful, clearer and more organized.Students were also frustrated by the fact that the class notes were hand written and they mentioned that they could benefit from being typed, as they are not otherwise searchable.The two textbooks (Hastie and Bishop) were however good references, but students recommended using Andrew Ng's notes from Stanford as another good reference to accompany the course material. \n\n\n	The exams were difficult, derivation-oriented, and heavily time-based.  Questions were similar to those on the problem sets, though sometimes on different topics.  Problems were often structured in a way that made it difficult to get points for later parts if one made a calculation mistake in the first part.  Students recommended doing practice tests and reworking problem set questions, since it was necessary to be very fast in doing the necessary derivations.  Unfortunately, the practice tests generally asked different types of questions than the real exams, so they turned out to be less useful than anticipated.  Students also warned that PhD students were graded with undergraduates and MEng students, so grading could be harsh for the latter given typical levels of prior experience among the former.  They noted that the first exam had focused primarily on probability and statistics rather than machine learning per se, while the second had been more reasonable in addressing the subject matter.  Both were open-notes/open-book/open-laptop (no Internet), which students found useful for looking up various formulas to start out with, but not as beneficial in determining how to approach the derivations.  Overall, spending lots of time practicing derivations from the problem sets was the most useful strategy for preparation.	Covers Machine Learning. It's important for everything.\n\nToo much content. Literally the entire Bishop text is covered in a semester. What?\n\nlots of gritty math\n\nI like machine learning, but I am afraid of it after taking this class.\n\nI took this subject because I wanted to learn the concepts to apply them to my research. Do not take this class if you need to achieve a certain grade unless you have a good basic knowledge of the topics already.\n\nThere should be a disclaimer for undergraduates and master's students, particularly those who have not seen a lot of machine learning previously.\n\nI did collaborate (which is extremely rare for me), and it did help, mostly in the sense of 'I'm just staring at this problem and have no idea what it's talking about', 'yep me too', 'okay good I'm not just stupid.'\n\nThere is a final project which was fun, as you can do whatever you want.\n\nThe exams seemed to be a severe time crunch to do lots of math, which seemed to benefit the IMO types but hurt more general understanding of the material. To do well on quizzes you have to be a probability whiz kid.\n\nThe grading policy was silly, hard cutoffs have no place in a graduate subject.\n\nProf. Kaelbling's lectures were very clear and energetic. She did a very good job of exposing us to a wide variety of ideas from machine learning.	Students were overall frustrated with the class.  Undergraduates generally felt lost, while noting that the PhD students had seen much of the material before.  Some even suggested including a disclaimer for undergraduates and MEng students.  Many students suggested giving the exams a lower weighting or replacing them with take-home tests, since they felt time constraints had played too much of a role in determining their subject grades.  They also considered it unreasonable that such high cutoffs for subject grades had been set before the exam averages were known.  The homework, lecture notes, and exams tended to cover different material, so students found it difficult to prepare for the exams.  The second exam was cumulative and some students felt it should have been given during finals week (the subject is a graduate class so undergraduate term regulations do not apply).  Lecture was often too high-level given the lack of real recitations and the impossibility of getting hands-on advice on all of the topics in office hours.  The classroom did not have enough seats for everyone in the class, which discouraged lecture attendance.  Students wished there had been real recitations rather than grading sessions designed to prevent the TAs from having to grade assignments.  Piazza was useful, but important course announcements sometimes became buried in the Piazza summary digests.  Problem sets would have been more useful if they had been of similar length and included more questions at different levels of difficulty to build intuition rather than jumping straight into lengthy derivations.  Practice questions should have been released for the exams, since past the exams in past years had been very different.  Inconsistent notation in the lectures and textbook made it unnecessarily tedious to correlate the two with one another.  Students felt that not enough time had been spent covering EM given its importance in the field and on the second exam.  The amount of material covered in general was widely considered unreasonable, and students wished there had been more of a course outline or framework to tie together the different topics.\n	http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.867/wiki/index.php?title=6.867_Machine_Learning_(2011_Fall)	f	f	AI	12	0	\N	\N	There was a calendar of lectures and the class adhered to it fairly well.

Lectures focused on existing adaptive technologies, while coursework focused on creating a finished prototype through an iterative design process. Over the semester, students met with their client and worked on designs and prototypes to meet his or her needs. Students also presented their work to a panel of AT experts, six weeks into the term and at the end of the term.

While there were no problem sets, the class had &quot;reflection assignments&quot; where students documented their progress in lab and reflected on any challenges that arose. They were not difficult or time-consuming, and students found them a helpful way to internalize concepts.	The core of the class was a semester-long project, with the goal of building a working prototype by the end of term. There were also some smaller lab assignments designed to explore or evaluate specific topics within Assistive Technology.

Since students have varying degrees of past experience in these areas, and because we present and build upon basic material, we recognize that some students may find parts of the course obvious, frustrating, and, on occasion, seemingly patronizing. However, no matter the experience level, there is always room for improvement. This is an unusual class in that the course's objective is to provide guidance and feedback as students complete the various assignments (rather than to teach a specific body of technical knowledge). Students get out of the class what they put into these assignments, and we invite them to 1) take the initiative to create customized value for themselves, 2) use the exercises and assignments to try new things, 3) improve their abilities in these important skills, and 4) develop their own personal style. We hope that students take the time to use 6.UAT as an opportunity to experiment and hone their skills -- an activity better done now, in a supportive environment with little consequence, as opposed to later, when mistakes can be professionally costly. The course is continually evolving, and we welcome input and suggestions for improvement. Finally, although not required, it is helpful if students have a thesis project or potential project idea in mind when starting the class.	This class teaches students oral and written communication skills for technical subject matter. Students prepared, delivered and revised several oral presentations over the course of the semester. Students also complete several written assignments and a number of in-class exercises to improve their presentation style.

This course provides a hands-on introduction to electrical engineering and computer science.  On completion of the course, students will have the skills and confidence to use electronics tools: oscilloscopes, function generators, multimeters and logical analyzers.  During the course, students will solder circuits, make measurements, and build interesting circuits such as an ECG amplifier that allows you to view your ECG on laptop, a digital lock similar to the one we have in the lab and other useful circuits.\n	The class provided students with hands-on experience on how to build circuits. The focus was definitely more on applications. The students felt that they didn't really acquire an equivalent theoretical foundation giving them insights into how the circuits actually worked, but most felt that there was a fair balance between application and theory. Undoubtedly the exposure to lab equipment and components was invaluable for future pursuits in EE.

There were no psets.	Students found the labs to be the essence of the course. They were more helpful than lectures, and they clarified concepts. Admittedly, the staff was very helpful with the lab-work which was found intimidating by the less experienced portion of students. The lab length was reasonable according to the majority, and they were definitely interesting and fun. 	The class was graded on a pass/fail basis based on attendance and effort primarily, given the diverse student backgrounds. It was viewed as being generous.  	There was no recommended textbook, and the notes were more than adequate. Students would have preferred color printouts so that they could read the resistance color coding scheme.

This class was offered as a joint 6&amp;15 course, so student opinion was split - many found the course material did not go in depth enough and lacked applications, while others thought it was too much material presented too fast.	Optimization topics	Too much material\nProblem set procedures	Students took this class either because it was a requirement for their graduate degree program or because they thought the material would be useful to their research.	Most students found that the problem sets contributed to their learning. The assignments were of variable length and posted at irregular intervals, making it hard to manage time appropriately. Most students claimed collaboration was essential, while others claimed the teacher forbade such collaboration.	There were no labs for this class.	Most students found the problem set grading to be highly inconsistent, seemingly dependent on which TA you had. The midterm grade was more consistent, but was highly correlated with how fast you worked, as no one finished the exam (so the more you got done, the higher score you could get).	In general the course textbook was hard to read and parse information out of.  The class notes were adequate but one had to attend class to acquire an understanding of the material.The book was really theoretical, and went into details on many aspects. Some students found the slides to be relatively brief. In conclusion, the textbook is not an easy read and the notes are useful but could also be improved. They relate a lot to the textbook.   \n\n\n\n	There was one midterm and a final exam in this class. The midterm was very long and covered a lot of material without enough time, but the grading seemed to compensate for the lack of time. The midterm did not seem to be drawn from problem set problems, making it even harder.	Gives a very good overview of optimization methods to understand the applications of each which was useful in my research.\nJames Saunderson was a phenomenal TA. He explained the material thoroughly, gave great examples and clear explanations, and was constantly available outside of class and via email.	Students had a LOT of feedback:\n* some felt too much time was spent on basics and the pace was too slow\n* others felt you covered too much material in the course\n* A lot of people felt the midterm was unreasonable, both in length and expectations. They would have liked more practice problems and better preparation.\n* Many suggested abandoning the lecture notes.\n* Others wanted a pre-defined schedule of when problem sets would be released and when they would be due.\n* Many requested that more (real-life) applications of the material be presented.		f	f	COM	12	0	\N	\N	Yes, the objectives were clearly presented, but several of them were not covered by the end of the class.

Also, they thought it was a good introduction to finite difference, volume and element methods. Other students took it to learn methods that were vital to their research, or to prepare for their PhD qualifying exams. 	The 4 assignments were found to be extremely useful by the students. The projects were admittedly long and tough. Even after determining how to solve the problem and deriving equations for the numerical scheme, implementation and debugging took a long time as well. It was however a rewarding experience and collaboration helped. 	There were no labs. 	The grading was very fair and the class was A and B centered. It was not difficult to get an A. 	Students found the lecture notes to be essential and the course notes to be very useful. They were for the most part well done. The notes contain some additional information, that might not be necessary.No textbook covered a large portion of the material, but having access to the LeVeque books was convenient for some. The notes for finite difference and elements were great, whereas the boundary element notes needed to be expanded according to some students. Views on whether or not the notes could stand alone outside of class differed. \n	There were no exams. 		The students had several suggestions for ways in which the class could be improved in the future. They would have liked the staff to better follow the schedule. The also wanted the time to be a little later in the day. Some also recommended a more gentle high level introduction to numerical methods at the beginning.

The subject is pitched to graduate students with interest in semiconductors, whether electrical engineers, material scientists, physicists, etc. The material in 6.720 is useful beyond electronic devices and it is helpful to understand many aspects of photonic devices, solar cells, microelectromechanical devices, etc. 	The class covered the basics of semiconductor devices building up from the fundamentals.	Professor del Alamo\nCourse notes	Lengthy problem sets\nLong exams	Students took this course either because it was in their research area or because they were interested in the course topics.	The problems were considered to be fairly straightforward and helpful to learning the material but also very time consuming.	The use of iLab for certain problem sets was considered helpful to understand device behavior. Not enough comments were provided to discuss the final design project.	Grading was considered to be very reasonable and fair.	The students praised the course textbook. Some said it was one of the best they have seen so far, and that it surely would become a standard reference for the subject in the future.The class notes were very informative albeit a little too detailed at times. The textbook being written by the professor also followed well with his teaching content and style.\n\n	The exams for this class were comprehensive in material and were more difficult than the problem sets. Students felt that the exams were too long for the time allotted.		Possible improvements to the course include having fewer problem sets or exams and referencing other texts than simply the course notes. Moreover, students felt that the recitation format could have been altered to cover more material and that the course notes should include solutions to the end-of-the-chapter problems for their own practice purposes.		f	f	MDN	12	2	\N	\N	Students felt that the objectives were clearly laid out and followed fairly closely.

There was a wide range of content, including network problems, matrix solution techniques, Newton methods, and numerous numerical techniques for ordinary and partial differential equations and dynamical systems.  Students considered the content interesting and empowering, and thought each topic followed the previous one in a logical manner.\n\n	Fascinating, useful content\nNo hard deadlines\nNo exams\nOpportunity to correct problem sets\nProf. Luca Daniel\n	Work load sometimes high\nNo textbook	Students took the class primarily due to degree requirements or out of an interest in applied mathematics and computer models.  They felt it provided a good survey of the subjects in numerical simulation and that the coursework had been effective in reinforcing the material.  They strongly recommended it to others interested in the area or doing research involving ODE solvers, finite element analysis, or dynamical systems.	Students found the problem sets very useful.  Most involved substantial Matlab programming.  They were often quite lengthy, albeit shorter than they had been in previous years.  Most students considered collaboration important in doing well, and some students wrote that they would not have been able to finish the assignments without working together.  Office hours, the class lecture notes, and the 2.005 lecture notes were also helpful.  Note that the problem sets comprise essentially the entire class grade.\n	There were no labs in this class.	Students were extremely pleased with the grading policy.  It depended solely on solving problems, with no deadlines, time limits, or lack of clarity in expectations.  The class grade was comprised entirely of problem set scores.  Deadlines were only recommendations, and work could be submitted later if necessary.  Students willing to spend time correcting their work could re-submit any formerly incorrect answers for credit.  This helped them better understand the material and contributed to a very high proportion of &quot;A&quot;s in the class.\n	The class notes were extremely important and sufficient.Video lectures from previous years were available and helpful in accompanying condensed notes and slides. A textbook did not exist. \nThe class notes and powerpoints were useful for completing the assignments.  \nSome students felt that there was in inherent drawback, the lack of enough references, due to the material being very recent. \n	There were no exams in this class.  Students greatly appreciated this.	I thought the class did very well at giving a broad and balanced introduction to important concepts in numerical simulation.	Unfortunately, the lack of problem set deadlines prevented the course staff from being able to release solutions.  Some students wished it would have been possible to obtain them at the end of the semester, at least, since feedback on problem sets was somewhat limited.  Relatedly, students wanted more feedback, since the problem sets were the only way to learn the material.  Assigned textbooks would have also been helpful, since students occasionally found the lectures and lecture notes insufficient to completely understand how to do the problem sets.  Students wished more time would have been spent on the second half of the material, while the first seemed too slow.\n		f	f	math	12	0	\N	\N	The class had a schedule of lectures, which it followed precisely.

However, many also took this class to fulfill their department lab or AUS requirement.	The problem sets were time consuming, but also very useful. They were not the focus of the course, and tested the technical aspects of coding UI more than the concepts of design. The first few problem sets could be difficult for students who didn't know any HTML, CSS, or JavaScript going into the class.	The primary lab component of this class was the semester-long group project. It was open-ended but had a lot of checkpoints throughout the semester. It guided students through the design process. Many students felt this was the most valuable part of the class.	Most people thought the grading was fair and relatively uniform.  However, some felt that the grading of the group project was not transparent.  Students appreciated knowing the grade cutoffs (90% for a guaranteed A).	This class had no textbook, but annotated lecture slides were posted on the course website.  Students found these comprehensive and helpful, especially when preparing for the nanoquizzes.	In place of exams, the class had 5-minute nanoquizzes every class.

It covers the development of the crystal, regenerative, tuned radio frequency [TRF], neutralized TRF [Neutrodyne], reflex, and superheterodyne AM/FM receiver topologies. \n\nFive labs use JFETs as tube substitutes to study series and parallel resonant circuits, regenerative circuits, intermediate frequency amplifiers, RF oscillators and mixers, the Miller effect, single-ended transformer-coupled audio amplifiers, push-pull transformer-coupled audio amplifiers, common triode and pentode topologies.  AM and FM receivers are covered.  Students restore [and keep] an antique radio receiver as a lab project; this requires an oral presentation and a paper detailing the features of the radio circuit design.\t\n\nThis class is an elective.

One of my industry associates got a patentable idea from studying the circuit of my 1936 General Electric “Colorama” radio.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nStudents who want hands-on RF lab and measurement experience should take this course; those who want a practical understanding of fundamental high frequency design topologies.\t\t\t\n\nI want students to be able to look at an RF receiver schematic and explain what just about every resonant circuit, resistor, capacitor, inductor and active device contributes to the functionality of the receiver.  We give them lots of hands-on experience and guidance until it’s time to take the training wheels off! The two major concepts would be the practical applications of series and parallel tuned circuits and a thorough understanding of the RF design fundamentals that are still valid and in use today. \n\nStudents are encouraged to help each other with concepts involved in the labs, the problem sets, and the project.  However, lab work and solutions and problem set solutions should be the work of the individual.	This class offered a good balance of lab work and theory.

The problem sets were more difficult than the lectures implied they would be, but were very useful.  Problem sets involved using MatLab, but were mostly conceptual.  Sometimes the wording was difficult to understand, but TAs were helpful in explaining the questions.	There were no labs or design projects for this course.	The grading distribution was not available, but should have been relatively lenient.	The textbook was still a rough draft, so while it contained the essential information and explained certain content well, some of the material was missing.  Most of the resources available provided a qualitative understanding of the material.	The final exam was the last problem set, which was supposed to be about twice as long as a typical problem set.		The reading material and lecture notes were often not posted before the homework was due, even though they would have been helpful.  This also prevented students from reading ahead if they wanted to get ahead.  Others suggested having a lab, or making the problem set questions more accessible, to help students learn the material.  Outside of the course material, many students found the new online course website (Lore/Coursekit) frustrating and difficult to use.

Instead they focused more on applying concepts, which in the end helped  students with the midterm project.  There were only a few problem sets throughout the semester.  	The projects helped reinforce the material taught in class and helped develop intuition for analog circuit design.  Though the projects were interesting, they were time consuming.	The grading seemed to be fair.  Those who completed the assignments should have done well in the class.	Some enjoyed the textbook and found it a good reference text, while others thought it was out of date and too dry to be useful.  Lecture notes seemed to be popular overall, although they didn't have detailed analyses of the circuits.  Students found using either resource useful since Professor Lee went through the material quickly.	Students found the one midterm exam hard, but fair.  Many found it difficult to finish within one and half hours.		The class seemed to be split between those who were very experienced and doing research in the field, and those who were much less fluent in circuitry.  Some students found too much emphasis on basic materials, and suggested that more difficult topics should have been gone over in more detail, as this class is one of the highest level circuits courses.  Oftentimes, difficult material was glossed over, and students did not actually understand it. On the other hand, others suggested reviewing the basics in a little more depth.  Additionally, students thought that having a recitation to go through the material more thoroughly, and a tutorial on how to use the simulation software would have been beneficial.  \n\nSome thought the final project presentations should have been moved to the end so teams could present on solid results, and the meetings with the professor/TA should have occurred earlier in the term.\n\nSome would have preferred blackboard explanations over the PowerPoint slides.		f	f	CIR	12	4	\N	\N	The course followed the class objectives and syllabus.

Overall, problem sets were very useful and helped with learning the material.  Collaboration was helpful.  	Labs were generally useful and cool to see in action. 	Students found grading to be fair.  Some were unhappy about the heavy weight of problem sets on final grades, but exam grading was fair. 	Students found that the online course notes were very comprehensive and helped as reference for problem sets.

The class emphasized both fundamental concepts (modularity, namespaces, conceptual models) as well as practical skills, with topics such as page structure, relational databases, schema design, application frameworks, and web security. Also, a significant component of the course taught the basics of functional programming. Students liked that the course taught both the concepts and the details of web programming. Overall, students enjoyed the content.	Final project\nAssignments\nProfessor Jackson\n	Large workload\nReading assignments	Students took this course to learn and practice web programming and to fulfill the Course VI department lab requirement.	There were five open-ended assignments that were each very very long, but also enjoyable and very helpful to learning the material. Students did not collaborate.	There were no labs, but a fun, open-ended final team project. Students liked the freedom to define their own final project.	Students noted that the grading policy was unclear and seemed fair but somewhat arbitrary.	There was no textbook for the class, but there were online lecture slides that students found somewhat helpful.	There were several nanoquizzes on Mondays, based on the reading assignments. Students felt the quizzes focused on small details from the reading and did not find them useful for learning the material.	This class was hands down the most useful class I've taken at MIT to date and I thoroughly enjoyed the content, but it was also the second most time consuming class I've ever taken.\n\nThis class translates very well to real world web development and you learn a lot of about good web programming practices.\n\n[Professor Jackson] He's British. So dreamy.	Students had a great deal of suggestions for the class. In general, students asked for more interactive lectures, more units for the class (or less workload), faster grading and feedback on assignments, and a clearer grading system.	https://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/6/sp12/6.170/	f	f	dept_lab	12	12	\N	\N	Objectives were met.

In general, students found the content to be relevant and important, but agreed that the workload was excessive.	Professor Golland	Long problem sets	Students took this course to satisfy the TQE requirement or for an Course VI M.Eng concentration requirement.	The problem sets were very long and difficult, involving a great deal of computation. Students found collaboration to be very helpful, especially to avoid wasting time figuring out minor mistakes. 	There were no labs in this course.	Grading was unclear to students.	There was no textbook for the course, but there were thorough class notes that students found to be very helpful.	There were two three-hour exams. The first exam was extremely long and difficult whereas students found the second exam to be much more reasonable. The exams tested understanding, but also involved a large amount of computation.	The content was really very beautiful and very important. I think all students of statistics, information theory, and modeling should take this course.\n\nProfessor Golland was gifted not only in the ability to design a great course, but also teach it in a clear way that makes you want to marry the course if it was a human being. 	Students suggested that the assignments should be much shorter and focus more on understanding rather than computation.		f	f	AI	12	\N	\N	\N	The class was well-organized, and the objectives were clearly stated and followed.

Students found the class interesting and useful, but thought the course could be condensed to contain more material.	Design problems\nNonlinear optics	Math\nGrading	Students took this class because they thought the topic was important to learn, and this class was the only nonlinear optics class offered at either MIT or Harvard.	The problem sets were long, and did not really help with understanding the material.  Sometimes the questions were poorly worded, making them difficult to understand.	There were no labs for this course.	The grading on homeworks and the quiz seemed to be random and inaccurate, and graders often did not consider solutions other than the standard one.	Some students found Yaviv's notes on electro-optical coefficients and Miller's notes on quantum mechanics useful.	Some students thought the quiz did not test understanding of the material.  The quiz questions were very similar to lecture material, but were long for a 90-minute quiz.

For those very familiar with the subject, the class was a bit slow, but for most it provided a good review of the material taught in 6.013 and taught new techniques for solving more advanced problems.	Subject\nProfessor Zahn	Problem sets\nSlow pace	Some students took the class for the Technical Qualifying Exam, and others took it to better understand Maxwell's equations for future electrical engineering classes or careers. 	Problem sets were sometimes long and difficult, but the solutions were available on OCW.  Doing them was useful for understanding the material.	There were no labs for this course.	The grading was fair.  The class did not grade on a curve; there were strict point cut-offs instead.	The resources for the class, which included textbooks and solution manuals, were available online.  However, the textbook was old and difficult to get through, and the course notes were best understood when Professor Zahn was teaching them.	The exams were relatively straightforward and fair, and seemed to test the students' knowledge of the subject well.  Overall, they were similar to previous years' quizzes and the homework assignments.		Since the class was held at night for 2 hours, many people ended up dozing off during class.  For better results, the students suggested that the class be offered as a normal daytime class that meets 2-3 times a week.  On the other hand, some suggested that Professor Zahn could perhaps ask more questions to the class to keep the class more engaged, especially during the long derivations.		f	f	OEE	12	0	\N	\N	The class met its objectives in a timely fashion.

Topics included the relational algebra and data model, query optimization, query processing, and transactions, focusing on how a database is built, not how it is used. Students enjoyed the subject matter and liked the way the theory content was tied into its application in real world systems.	Professor Madden\nLabs	Long exams\nLong problem sets	Students took this course out of interest in databases as well as to fulfill the Course VI AUS requirement or for Grad-H credit.	There were three long problem sets which were very useful for learning the material and practicing for the tests, as problem sets were due right before the exams. Students would have liked a larger number of shorter assignments rather than three long problem sets. Students found collaboration on the problem sets to be helpful.	There were several labs programmed in Java that students found to be fun and of reasonable length. The labs were not crucial to learning the material, and students occasionally found the labs to be difficult to debug. Students taking the graduate version of the course did not have to do two of the labs and instead completed an open-ended final project.	The grading seemed fair but was rather slow.	There was a textbook as well as lecture notes for the class. Students found both to be useful. There were also additional reading assignments of academic papers, which were interesting but not central to the subject material.	There were two open-book tests that were long and tricky, but fair and tested understanding very well.	This class is really necessary for having a deep understanding of what many web companies do even though most Course 6 students don't take this class.

Professor Watts\nModern optics and photonics	Details in homework solutions\nMultiple assignments per week\nNon-rigorous mathematics	Students took this class to learn more about the electromagnetic waves and the theory underlying photonic/optical devices.	The problem sets varied in tediousness and usefulness.  Some were numerical problems, which were time consuming but cool, and helped students understand the material.  The solutions to the problem sets could have been improved.	The design projects were very educational and well planned.  However, initial guidance would have been helpful, especially if the team did not have an expert on the subject.	Students found the grading fair.	Many found the textbook clearly written, but lacking in the mathematical derivations.	The exams helped some understand the material better. They were long and there were no practice exam solutions, though an equation sheet was allowed.		Students suggested having more detailed homework solutions, and improving the mathematical derivations to make them clearer and more rigorous.  Some would have liked having more connection between the mathematical results and physical interpretation, and some would have liked to go through more of the basic theorems like equivalence and reciprocity.

Students read and discussed several papers regarding important historical systems, and applied the concepts they learned to come up with system designs of their own. Overall, students enjoyed reading the papers and learning the material, but felt that the class could be improved in both presentation of topics and evaluation of students' understanding.	Relevant design projects\nKnowledgeable course staff\nHands-on assignments\nInteresting material	Harsh exams\nIntense workload\nLack of feedback	Students took this class mainly because it was a header requirement for Course 6-3 and a CI-M, and also because they were interested in the material.	There were seven hands-on assignments that covered basic UNIX concepts. These were fairly straightforward and graded on a check-plus/check/check-minus system, but no feedback was given because assignments are reused each year. Students agreed that assignments were easy but tedious, though opinions varied on the degree of helpfulness.	There were two design projects, one completed individually and one in a group. These projects involved coming up with a solution to a technical challenge and writing a technical paper to describe how the design worked. Students enjoyed applying the concepts they learned and thought that design projects were a great way to strengthen their understanding. For a class that advertised extensive writing and communication, students felt that there should have been more design projects, and also wished that more feedback had been provided.	Grading was for the most part deemed fair by students. Quiz grades were always very low because of the quiz format, but students felt that the grades and distributions were reasonable in other aspects of the class.	The official textbook was split into two sections, with one half in book form and the other half available for free online. Students found this format strange, but thought the content was very useful though verbose. In addition to the textbook, there were several technical papers that students had to read before each recitation.	There were two 50-minute quizzes during the semester, and one 90-minute quiz during finals week. Students had unanimously negative opinions toward these quizzes. They felt that the structure and content of the exam did not adequately test their understanding of the course material. In particular, the quizzes were structured as a series of multiple-choice or True/False questions, each worth 6-12 points, about select readings. No partial credit was awarded and students could also be penalized for guessing. Quizzes were open notes and allowed students to use laptops without Internet access, so many felt that the quizzes were just exercises in searching papers quickly.	I needed to take this subject to graduate, but I really enjoyed the class, because it was enlightening and informative.\n\nThe quizzes are really unbalanced. When a single multiple choice question is worth 10% of the entire quiz, you know something is wrong.	By far the largest complaint and requested area for change was on the quizzes. Students suggested that the quiz structure should be changed to focus more on lecture content, and also so there were more questions each worth a fewer amount of points.

Most found the first and third units, which covered bits and packets respectively, to be interesting and understandable, but thought the second unit, which covered signals and signal processing, to be too dense for one third of the semester.  Overall, many found that the class elucidated the mystery behind the communication systems used every day.	Professor Balakrishnan and TAs\nLabs\nReal world applications\nInteresting material	Long problem sets\nNoisy problem sets\nUnit 2 (Signals)\nCheckoffs	All students took the class because it was a requirement for Course VI, though some also had an interest in networks.	Most thought the problem sets were somewhat long, especially in the second unit when the material got much more difficult.  Many collaborated with friends and found going into lab to do the problem sets helpful, especially if they thought the wording in the Python tasks was confusing.  Students found doing the problem sets very useful in helping them understand the material and preparing for the tests.	The labs were presented with the problem sets as the coding section.  Students thought the labs helped them understand the protocols covered in class.  Again, some found the labs in the second section to be difficult.	Most found the grading fair, though they were unsure of the cut-offs and final distribution.  In some cases, students found that problem set grading varied with each grader.  There was also a &quot;mulligan&quot;, where students could retake a part of the second exam, since most of the class did not do well on that test.	There was no textbook; however, the course notes, which were written by the professors, were well-written and easy to understand.  Most, if not all, who read the course notes thought the notes were very helpful and had most of the information needed for the class.	Overall the students found the quizzes to be fair and reasonable, though the second quiz was much harder than the first and was quite lengthy.  Each quiz took most students the full two hours but fairly assessed what was taught.	"The channel between myself and Dr. Stojanovic was very lossy, and I was unable to decode many of the packets that he transmitted."	Most students suggested either reducing the amount of material taught in the second unit, or lengthening the amount of time spent on those sections, since the first section was much easier.  They also thought that the second unit's problem sets were not as well written and reasonable as those during the other two sections.		f	f	core	12	6	\N	\N	Most students thought the class followed the objectives closely.

A great deal of content was covered, and students commented that the second half of the course moved too quickly.	Straight-forward problem sets	Textbook	Students took this class to fulfill an EE header requirement.	There were 13 weekly problem sets that were short and easy. Students found the lecture slides, recitation notes, and office hours to be helpful in completing them.	There were no labs in this course.	Grading was fair, though some students disliked the 10% participation component. Students thought that grading feedback on problem sets was rather slow.	Students commented that the textbook was confusing and poorly formatted but found the lecture notes helpful and sufficient for doing well in the class.	There were two one-hour quizzes that were fair and tested the techniques of the class well.	[Professor Adalsteinsson] "This guy is the bomb. Made everything so clear. HE'S AWESOME."	Students thought that problem sets should not be due the same week as a test and agreed that the textbook was not useful and should be replaced. Students also commented on the large amount of basic math and algebra in the lectures was hard to follow and not productive towards learning the concepts.

The class was taught at a fair pace, and had many cool demos to show the concepts being taught in class.

Additionally, it teaches practical and tangible skills, and is great for those interested in circuits.	The problem sets were manageable, though sometimes lengthy.  The average student spent around six hours to complete a problem set.  Problem sets were helpful for learning the material overall.\n\nSome questions on the problem sets required the use of iLab, a remote device testing lab.  Some found iLab to be slow and difficult to use, while others found it to be an nice touch.	Most found the labs interesting and helpful for learning the concepts taught in class.  Others did not think the labs were helpful because they did not understand the lab material or because they preferred the lab extension (6.S076).\n\nThe instruments in general were reliable and accessible, except when the lab became crowded the day before the labs were due.  The hours were from 2-7 pm, which some found inconvenient.  However, the TAs often stayed late, and were helpful in debugging circuits and fixing most equipment issues.	The grading was not clearly defined, but there did not seem to be a hard cut-off for an A.	Those who used the textbook found it useful, clear, and thorough, but somewhat dense.  Class notes were found to be at least somewhat useful, and recitation notes were found to be very reliable and helpful as well.	Most found the quizzes fair if they attended lecture and recitation, and understood the material covered in class.  Still, most agreed that the quizzes were difficult, but not impossible, and were tight on time. The quizzes were dissimilar from the problem sets - the questions were of a different style and focused on a narrower range of topics.		Some suggested that the class should be more involved with the lab portion, including a more extensive lab training, as well as more labs.  However, several did not see the value of the iLab problem set questions, and sometimes found them confusing.\n\nWith respect to the non-lab portion of the class, some thought that lecture should be more dynamic and be done with chalkboard rather than PowerPoint.  Some thought that Piazza for the class would be beneficial and allow students to ask questions when they needed help.		f	f	core	12	4	\N	\N	Not enough comments for summary.

Professor Kellis\nOnly one quiz\nCurrent applications	Guest lecturers\nLack of project guidance\nLengthy problem sets	Students took this course because they were interested in computational biology. It also satisfied an AUS requirement and a BioEECS concentration for M.Eng degrees.	Problem sets were extremely useful but much too long and more time-consuming than expected for a 12-unit class. Graduate students completed an additional &quot;lab&quot; question as part of each problem set.	There were no labs, but there was a final project which could be completed with a partner. It gave students a taste for computational biology research.	Grading was pretty fair and students received A's if they completed all of the assignments and put effort into the class. 	No textbook, but scribe notes from previous years, which were compiled into a &quot;textbook.&quot; pretty useful when complete and well-written, some chapters were more useful than others	There was only one quiz in this class.

The workload was unbalanced, with small assignments in the first half and two big projects in the second half. Students felt that the projects were very time consuming and did not get enough feedback.  	There were no labs for this class. 	The syllabus gave the overall grading breakdown, but students were not sure of how the grades were decided for individual assignments and felt that it was quite subjective. Additionally, feedback often came quite late.	The textbook was written by one of the professors and very closely followed the lectures.	Not enough comments for summary.

Additionally, they felt they would be able to apply what they learned in their jobs and graduate school.	The problem sets were challenging, but students felt they were crucial for learning the material. Students appreciated that the problem sets were graded on effort and approach instead of just correctness.	The projects were flexible and students found them very helpful, especially because they could focus on something that interested them. Students found the main challenge was that many techniques required to complete the projects were taught at the end of the term.	Students felt that grading was very fair, and adequate partial credit was given throughout the course.	Students found both the notes and the textbook to be very helpful. Both were written by the lecturer, so they followed the class precisely.	Students found the quizzes to be a good test of understanding, and felt they were much easier than the homework problem. Quizzes were open book.	We learned how to optimally blackmail people and when to sell your house or take a job.	Some students felt the class could be improved by breaking the two halves of the class into two separate classes.

Professor Berwick\nNo exams\nDiscussion with Professor Chomsky	None	Students took 6.863 because it fulfilled an AUS or TQE requirement or because they were interested in the subject matter.	The problem sets supported the concepts taught in class by requiring implementations of the covered algorithms. Most problem sets involved Python programming.	The class had one final project. Students liked the fact that it was open-ended as it provided them a chance to showcase what they had learned while also exploring their own areas of interest.	The grading was chiefly automated, which seemed objective and fair to students. It was unclear, however, how the class participation component of the grade would be determined.

Professor Jaakkola\nInteresting and applicable material	Less effective recitations	Students took the class because it satisfied their Technical Qualifying Evaluation requirement, was relevant to their research, or was appealing because of its material.	The problem sets in the class had a reduced workload compared to previous years. Most students thought they were instrumental in learning the material.	There were no labs in the class.	Only a randomly chosen subset of each problem set was graded. Additionally, students who did better on the final exam than on the midterm could choose to have their midterm discounted. Several students, however, weren't sure about the grading policies of the class. 	Students found the provided lecture notes to be useful. Some of them also liked the textbook by Michael I. Jordan that was made available online.	The class had one midterm and a final exam. There was plenty of time to finish the midterm, and a sheet of notes was allowed in the exam as well. Students thought that the final was longer and more challenging.		Students suggested that the first half of the course be done faster to leave more time for the denser second half.

Many people also took it because in addition to being a requirement for Course IV, it is also a prereq for many more advanced EECS courses.	Students thought weekly tutor problems were incredibly useful and relevant to the current topic. Some people thought the problems could be a little repetitive, but others enjoyed the exposure to a lot of the problems because it helped solidify the material. Students also mentioned it was helpful to complete some of the week's tutor problems before a software or design lab in order to be prepared. Collaboration was an individual decision for this class; some people chose to complete the vast majority of problems on their own while others always worked with peers.	Most people thoughts the labs were a great way to internalize the material taught in class. A few were concerned that a couple labs were too long for the time allocated. Another concern was the lack of clarity of some of the instructions. Many students suggested taking real advantage of the TAs and LAs on hand during labs to help you understand what to do or the material itself. Some students considered the labs one of the most effective ways they learned during the class.	Most students agreed that grading on exams was fair. In addition, many liked the lenient late policy for the course. However, the lack of curve and unusually high grade cutoffs (100-90 A,  90-80 B , 80- 70 C) struck many as a little bit extreme for an MIT class environment.	While there is no physical textbook for 6.01, there is a large set of class notes that take its place. There are mixed reviews of the notes; while a majority thought they were helpful, especially when read before lecture, there was a small portion who barely touched the class notes or thought they were too lengthy and preferred the lecture notes.	Nanoquizzes had material of a fair level but were often stressful for students because of the 15 minute time limit. Students agree that the exams are difficult. Although you get to bring in unlimited written and printed materials, many thought they were not useful because exams were definitely about applying your knowledge of difficult concepts rather than a reproduction of homework problems. Students recommend getting as much exposure to previous exam problems as a good way to study.		Students suggested going into more detail on examples and perhaps covering more difficult examples in lecture.

Starting with MOS transistors, the course developed of series of building blocks -- logic gates, combinational and sequential circuits, finite-state machines, computers and finally complete systems. Both hardware and software mechanisms were explored through a series of design examples.	Clear grading system\nBuilding the beta\nVideo lectures\nFast Piazza answers	Quizzes\nDebugging labs\nUnderstaffed lab hours	Students generally took this class to fulfill the Course VI department requirement.  Some enrolled out of personal interest.  	There were no problem sets for this class.  	The labs were very useful in helping students better understand the material.  Most of the assignments took a reasonable amount of time to complete, but lab 6, designing the beta processor, was notorious for taking a long time and requiring a lot of debugging.  Labs used the class software, JSIM and BSIM, and could be completed on students' personal computers or on the athena desktops.  	The grading policy was strictly point based, and the grade cutoffs were made clear at the beginning of the semester.  Labs were automatically graded, and each lab needed to be completed in order to pass the class.  Students found this system to be very fair and liked that they could see where they stood at any time.  	There were no assigned readings for this course.  However, the course site had links several reference sheets for different topics and a useful handbook written by a previous 6.004 TA, Margaret Chong.  	Quizzes were fairly predictable and the format and questions were similar to those in the past years.  Students generally thought that they were fair, although the material became more challenging further into the semester.  	Building the Beta is probably the coolest thing I have ever done. When your Beta finally works, you will shed tears of joy.\n\nI found [that watching the lectures on] YouTube at 1.5 speed was just about the optimal way to experience the lectures.

Many students also wanted to learn more about software construction techniques and to gain more practical programming experience. 	The class was assigned a total of five problem sets, each of which had a beta submission and a final submission.  After the beta, students would receive feedback on their submission through results from the autograder and from critiques by their peers on the class's code review system.  During the final submission, they would have the opportunity to correct bugs found by the autograder and respond to the comments from the code review.  Students generally felt that the problem sets were useful for learning the course material, and some students found that collaboration was helpful.  	There were a total of two group projects, which were time consuming but also helped students learn and implement the design concepts taught in class.  Though students felt that working in a team was a valuable experience, some found it difficult to split the workload between team members.  	Most students felt that the overall grading policy was fair and liked that their grade was mostly based on their performance on the problem sets and projects.  However, students did not like the fact that grades for the design projects were variable, depending highly on the standards of the TA that they were assigned to.  	The class did not have a textbook.  Students generally described the lecture notes as unhelpful and many referred to the course notes from previous semesters, in particular those from Fall 2012.  	There were two quizzes, both of which were multiple choice.  Opinions varied on the fairness of the material; however, most students agreed that they did not have much overlap with the assignments.

Students generally felt that the assignments were lengthy and became more time consuming towards the end of the class.  Many students benefited from working together.  	This course did not have a lab component. 	The grade distribution was not transparent, but the general consensus was that grading was fair.  The grading for the assignments was not always consistent, and some students did not understand why they received the grade that they did.  	There were no assigned readings for the class, although there was a course textbook written by Professor Guttag, who developed the class.  Many of the students did not use the course text, and the opinions of those who did were varied.  The class did not adhere strictly to the textbook, and several topics were missing from the reading while others were difficult to find.  	There were two quizzes and one final exam.  Students were allowed to bring two double-sided sheets of notes to the quizzes.  The material drew from concepts covered in lectures and the problem sets, although many felt that the questions were too nitpicky and some asked about vocabulary covered during class.  		Students felt that the grade distribution should have been clearly stated at the start of the semester.

However, many students also took this class to fulfill their AUS or department lab requirement.\n	There were three problem sets in addition to two written assignments. Students felt that the assignments were useful, practical and helped to learn Javascript and JQuery. Some students found the problem sets time consuming because they did not have a strong background in HTML, CSS, Javascript or JQuery.	The primary lab component of this class was the semester-long group project (groups consisted of three to four members). The project was open-ended and had seven checkpoints (GRs) that guided students through the design process of a user interface.\nStudents felt that the group project helped them to better understand the subject. Some student felt that they were forced to spend too much time on the design process and as a result they were pressed on time to actually code their project.	Although a cutoff was not specified, most students thought the grading was fair. Some students felt that the grading of the group project was subjective.	The class had no textbook, but annotated lecture notes were posted on the course website before the class. The notes were required reading since student had nanoquizzes that were based on the notes. Students found them helpful and valuable, and for some, even enough to self-teach themselves the material.	Instead of midterms, the class had short nanoquizzes at the beginning of every class. Nanoquizzes were based on the required reading. Some students thought they were too specific, tricky and subjective. Most students preferred nanoquizzes to midterms.

Assignments include substantial readings and a term project, where students build an interface to illustrate one or more themes of the course.	6.835 focused on multi-modal interaction and related technologies in the field of Human Computer Interaction. Students learned about various modes of interaction, which rely on methods such as image, gesture, and stroke recognition. 	Professor Davis\nProjects	Readings\nAmbiguous grading	Students who were interested in HCI or were concentrating in HCI for their M.Eng. chose this class due to its relevance in the field. Many students also took this class because it was a Grad-H level course. 	Problem sets were in the form of four mini-projects that were assigned every two weeks. For students with limited MATLAB experience the projects took a significant amount of time to complete. Some students found the assignments reasonable to complete alone, and others found it beneficial to collaborate with others. While the assignments sometimes offered a limited amount of information and guidance for completion, they helped students understand the class material. Overall the mini-projects seemed useful and fair, despite some bugs in the code and ambiguity in the instructions.	While there were no labs in the class, there was a final project that was stated to be the main focus of the course. Students worked on it either individually or in pairs and had three to four weeks to complete it at the end of the semester. It was open-ended and challenging, which was fun and fulfilling. However, there were no checkpoints for completing the project, so seeking help from the class staff was beneficial to doing the project well.	Grading for the class consisted of four categories: mini-projects, readings, class participation, and a final project. The grading was very ambiguous in terms of the weight distribution for assignments. For both the readings and the mini-projects, feedback on assignments were given weeks after assignments were due. In the case of some assignments, no feedback was given until the very end of the semester. 	This class did not use a textbook but required that students read two to three papers before each class. While the papers were relevant to the field, they were occasionally dry and difficult to read. Readings were assigned and posted online at most three days before written responses to the reading was due. These responses consisted of answers to questions specific to each of the papers and needed to be handed in as hard copy during lecture.	There were no quizzes or exams in this class. 	"No idea what the grading is like. Basically gambling."	Most suggestions for this class involve the mini-projects.

However, a number of students also cited interest in signal processing as motivation to take the class.  Many students also took the class because they liked 6.003.  	The problem sets were difficult but helped the students understand the concepts.  Problems were sometimes long and required a lot of math.  Many students found collaboration useful and liked the open office hours three nights a week.  In addition, reviewing problem sets was a good way to study for exams.	There were no labs.	Problem sets were graded on a 0-3 scale.  Students generally thought grades were assigned fairly.	A course reader was used for the class.  These class notes were useful to students and followed lectures closely.  However, students felt that the notes were not detailed enough and wished the course reader contained more examples.  In addition, the notes could be disorganized in places.  The textbooks for 6.003 and 6.041 were used by some students as references.  	The class consisted of two midterms, which were regarded as being fair but difficult.  The exam questions resembled questions on the problem sets and tested material covered in class well.  Students thought the exams tested how well the material was understood rather than how well the formulas were memorized but felt the exams were long.

The class taught students how to approach programming problems as well as techniques to write clear and robust code.  Concepts introduced in class covered a wide range of topics, including object-oriented programs, the environment model, recursion, abstraction, and meta-circular evaluators.  Many students felt that the class relied too much on theory although problem sets and labs were generally considered to be a good way to apply concepts learned in class.  In addition, many students commented that they learned a lot in the class although the language used in the class, Scheme, was not useful in many places outside of the class.  	Interesting content\r\nScheme\r\nProject 4\r\nOnline Tutor (and check button)\r\n	Lectures\r\nTime Sink\r\nExams (Coding on Paper)	Most students took the class because it was a requirement for Course VI.  Some students also used the class to decide if they wanted to declare a Course VI major while others wanted to learn to program well.	Problem sets were generally considered helpful toward learning the material and were not too difficult.  Most students liked the online tutor system and the check button, which allowed students to verify that their answers were correct before they turned in the problem sets.  The problems helped students understand the basics of the material and were good preparation for doing the projects.  Students did not collaborate much on problem sets but did help each other debug code or work out the more tricky problems.  Bibles were generally not used.  	The class had five projects that students generally enjoyed.  While they could be time-consuming, the projects were reasonable in length if started early enough.  The complexity of the projects allowed students to gain a more in-depth understanding of the material than allowed by doing the problem sets.  Many students felt that the projects were fun and interesting but recommended starting early!	Grading in the class was considered fair by the students.  However, students felt that quizzes were graded harshly.  	The textbook, &quot;Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs&quot; (2nd Edition) by Abelson, Sussman, and Sussman, was used mainly as a reference by students.  It was available online but not integrated into the course.  The class notes and online lectures were helpful to students. 	Student opinion was split over how well exams contributed to the class.  Some felt that exams were fair and tested what students knew while others felt that exams were very hard.  Many students found the transition from coding on a computer to coding with pen and paper difficult.  Small errors that would have been caught by a compiler caused students to lose points on the exam. Some also felt exams were long.

Professor Akinwande\r\nOffice hours\r\nCircuits	Amount of material\r\nLong problem sets\r\nToo many equations	Most students took the class because it is an EE header for Course VI.  Some students also cited interest as a reason for taking the class.	The problem sets were long and included a lot of grungy math.  Some students felt that they were helpful while others felt that the problems degenerated into meaningless number crunching.	Students had differing opinions about the two design projects.  The first was relatively quick while the second was more time-consuming.  Some felt that they were useful in learning the material while others felt that they involved too much random guesswork.  Students generally disliked the second one because of its length, difficulty, and proximity to the final.	Students felt that the grading was fair but tough.  Grades were determined by problem sets (20%), exams (30%), design projects (20%), and the final (30%).	Students generally appreciated both the lecture notes and the textbook (&quot;Microelectronics&quot; by Howe and Sodini).  Some felt that the textbook was too dry to follow while others used it extensively as a reference to prepare for lecture and reinforce concepts.  The lecture notes were very detailed and included much of the material students neede to know.	The quizzes were fair but possibly too long.  They are open book tests, but students felt that understanding the concepts was still essential to doing well on the tests.  A good calculator is necessary because of the math involved.	"Very in-depth material but I left wishing there was more breadth and fewer details."	The class focuses too much on calculation and number crunching rather than concepts.  More breadth into other devices would be appreciated.  More distributed office hours would be nice.

The emphasis of the class is on problem solving using probabilistic tools. The class is targeted towards engineering students who will be using these tools in diverse applications. The main concepts that the class seeks to convey are the correct interpretation of random variables and a good toolbox for probabilistic problem solving.\r\n\r\nThis class is a requirement for some majors and an elective for others, although many Course VI students choose it as a math elective, because of its applicability to many domains of their major. This class is also a prerequisite to several other classes. Students need only have completed the Freshman calculus requirement to take this class. \r\n\r\nStudents are allowed to collaborate and use various sources, but they need to disclose their collaboration and their sources. 	The subject covers various aspects of probability, ranging from discrete to continuous probability.  The class had a good balance between theory and application, although some felt it was more theoretical than they expected.

Some also thought the material would be helpful in their research or real world situations.	The problem sets were useful to the understanding of the material.  Some of them were long, and students would have preferred more problems with numerical results instead of completing proofs.  Graduate students had to complete extra problems, which they found to be much more difficult and time-consuming.  Most students collaborated with each other, or attended office hours.	\N	Students thought grading in general was fair, and liked the partial credit given on problems in the quizzes.  Many students complained that problems sets only made up 10% of the grade, and that the way they were graded (by randomly selecting problems) was unfair.  Some students were frustrated by the lack of feedback on grades, as they did not know where they stood in the class leading up to the final.	The textbook was very helpful, and many students found reading the textbook essential to completing the problem sets and doing well in the class.  Students found the lecture notes hard to follow and not very useful.  They also didn't contain answers to examples worked out in class.	There were two quizzes over the course of the semester.  The first quiz was comparable to the problem sets, but many students felt quiz 2 was long and didn't accurately represent the material.  Students would have liked more varied and shorter problems on the exam, as they contained only 2 problems which didn't address the variety of material in the class.	"I think it's the most useful class I have ever taken in MIT"\r\n\r\n"Quiz 2 was a beast."\r\n	The most common suggestion for the class was to make the lectures more interesting and useful, either by changing the style (moving away from projectors) or the lecturer.

The first half covers fundamentals of photography and electronic flashes, including experiments on application of electronic flash to photography, stroboscopy, motion analysis, and high-speed videography. During this period, students write five extensive lab reports and present one oral lab report. In the second half of the term, students work in small groups to select, design, and execute independent projects in measurement or photography that apply learned techniques.\r\n\r\nWhy should a student elect to take Strobe Lab? If you wish to improve your communication skills, if you wish to learn how to work effectively in a laboratory, or if you want to learn how to capture and investigate events that are too swift to be seen, then you will find the subject interesting. All of these (particularly the first two) are of great help if you will be conducting academic or applied research.\r\n\r\nWho should take Strobe Lab? Those who are interested in the subject matter should take the class. Those who want an easy lab should not. This subject is intended to challenge your ability to prepare a thorough engineering memorandum describing your work, create engaging images that communicate technical information, and plan and execute a multi-week project as one of a team of four. It takes time and effort to do these well, and we expect a solid 12-hour-per-week contribution from each student.\r\n\r\nThe philosophy of 6.163 is: &quot;Work hard, tell everyone everything you know, close a deal with a handshake, and have fun.&quot; (Prof. H. E. Edgerton)\r\n\r\nCollaboration Policy: Lab experiments are carried out in groups of 4. The 5 written lab reports, the oral lab report, the homework, and the quiz are individual efforts. On the reports and the homework, students must make a good faith effort to execulte the assignment on their own. If they need assistance after that, they may discuss methods and techniques with anyone else they choose, but the actual work (be it solving homework problems, writing text, plotting graphs, creating photographic prints, etc.) must be their own. The reports for the feasibility study and the final project are collective efforts of each lab group. \r\n\r\nNo major changes to the subject are anticipated for the Spring 2007 offering.\r\n	In addition to basic photography, students learned a variety of strobe and high speed imaging techniques in 6.163.  The class also focused on teaching students to plan and execute experiments in lab while also emphasizing lab reports and presentations.	&quot;Everything&quot;\nCool images\n	Long lab reports	Students took this class because they were interested in the subject, and because it fulfilled the Department and Institute lab requirements.  	There was one problem set which was useful for studying for the test and reviewing the more technical aspects of strobe lab.	Labs were useful for learning the material and reasonable in length.  Students commented that the labs were very hands-on and enjoyed taking cool pictures in lab.		There were no readings.	There was one quiz, which was generally considered fair, and was similar to the problem set.

The course covers both advanced physical models and practical aspects of major processes such as thermal oxidation, solid-state diffusion, ion implantation, epitaxial growth, etching, and silicides.  In particular, advanced models for diffusion (transient enhanced diffusion) and ion implantation are emphasized.  The impact of processes and process integration on device characteristics (e.g. reverse short channel effect) is also discussed.  Focus is on physical understanding, with exposure to concepts used in process modeling and simulation.  A lecture is included on strained Si CMOS and SiGe growth and processing issues.  Students are given the opportunity to use a modern process simulator in the homework assignments and in the Final Project.\r\nThis subject is not required.  However, it is strongly recommended for anyone considering a career in or related to microelectronics/microfabrication, and for graduate students doing research in that area.  In particular, this class forms an essential theoretical and practical foundation for graduate students planning a thesis involving device fabrication and/or processing.  Students interested in nanofabrication will also benefit from a thorough understanding of modern CMOS processing.\r\nThe course is geared towards graduate students, however it can be taken by advanced undergraduates as well as masters students and Ph.D. candidates.  It is helpful to have exposure 6.152J, but this is\r\na recommendation and is not required (the text is complete enough to take care of background issues).  Students who have been exposed to\r\nbasic concepts of the MOSFET (e.g. 6.012) will better appreciate the in-class examples on how processing impacts devices.  Students who have taken 6.152J will find some overlap with this course in the beginning, but additional depth is included in 6.774.\r\nThe teaching philosophy for this subject is to combine fundamental physical background with modeling techniques as well as exposure to &quot;practical&quot; aspects.  The textbook by Plummer et al, does a very good job of this.  In addition, material from recent conference publications is added to the lectures, to expose students to\r\npractical use of the concepts in the course.  Another part of the teaching philosophy in this subject is that students need to gain experience using modern simulation tools (such as SUPREM) in order to better understand how the models work in practice.  Homework assignments emphasize checking the results of simulations against hand calculations, where possible, to make sure that the simulations make sense.  Students are given a chance to practice their public speaking skills by doing a polished oral presentation at the end of\r\nthe semester (in place of a written report).  Key concepts include: (1) the link between the fabrication process and the final device\r\nproperties, and (2) how simulations can predict complex processes and interactions among processes in a CMOS fabrication flow, as demonstrated by exercises using the SUPREM simulator.  Students learn best in this area by discussing ideas with each other.  Collaboration is allowed and encouraged.  The syllabus as well as some of the details of the material is updated each time the subject is taught, since the field changes rapidly.	6.774 provided a broad overview of CMOS processing.  Students learned about device fabrication, including oxidation, dopant diffusion, and ion implantation.

Some of the problem sets in 6.774 were long, but most were fairly straightforward.  They were useful to learn how the use the simulator (TSUPREM).	Students chose their own design projects and were given about two and a half weeks to complete the design.  The project required outside literary research and simulations and calculations.

The first half of the class was fairly theoretical while the second half discussed actual systems.	Rivest\r\nOpen-ended final project\r\nFun problems and a light workload	Problem sets\r\nFinal project ambiguities\r\nMidterm	Most took this class out of an interest in security and cryptography.  Some also cited Prof. Rivest as motivation to take the class while others used the class as an elective to fulfill graduation requirements.	The problems sets were always done in groups of 3 to 4 -- collaboration was mandatory. Most problem sets required some research and application of creativity. The problems were not limited to material covered in lecture.  Good group dynamics were essential to enjoying the problem sets. Students did not use bibles.	There was a group open-ended final project. Student chose their topic and were graded on their proposal, write-up draft, presentation, and final report.  Opinions about the project were divided. Many thought the project was fun and interesting and took the loose constraints as license to be creative.  Other found the goals too vague and poorly defined and had difficulties determining what was expected from their project.	Most students found the grading fair.  Grades consisted of the midterm (15%), final project (40%), and problem sets (45%).	There is no textbook and there are few class notes. Links were given to relevant articles. Several students thought Wikipedia and Google were the best references available.	There was one open-note quiz. Student found that it was long and difficult and contained ambiguous and tricky questions.  Some also felt that the questions were not representative of material covered in the class.

Students spend the second half of the term designing and building their own projects.  The class is an elective which teaches students analog circuits and circuit design and allows students to participate in a group design project that simulates design practices in industry, or to satisfy the MIT or the EECS Department Lab requirement.  Students also work with expert analog engineers from local analog companies.  Several graduate students have taken this course to get background for research work.\r\n                                                                                                    \r\nStudents who want to learn analog circuits and who like hands-on lab work should take 6.101.  Students who would like to work closely with the instructor and local analog engineers from industry on design projects. \r\nA student needs to understand the basic principles of electronic circuit analysis well, i. e. 6.002 or equivalent.\r\n\r\nMy teaching philosophy is to minimize mathematical transfer functions and solutions and to emphasize visual and intuitive circuit understanding; to create a practical and useful design experience.  In the process, students will learn to understand and use a wide variety of analog circuits.  They will learn how to use books, periodicals, and websites to find circuit ideas and to supplement their textbook knowledge.  Additionally, 6.101 is supported during the project phase by engineers from local analog companies.  These engineers come to MIT to help students with their projects in person, as well as providing assistance via phone and e-mail.	6.101 was a work intensive class that covered a wide range of elements of analog circuitry, including BJTs, JFETs, and operational amplifiers.  Students felt that the class was strongly application intensive.  However, opinions were mixed regarding how theoretically thorough 6.101 was.  Some students said not enough time was spent on theory while others felt that the theory they learned was sufficient.\r\n	Working with people from industry on circuits.\r\nFinal Project\r\nThis class!	Living in lab\r\nLong labs	Most students took the class because they wanted to learn more about analog circuit design.  Some students also cited the fact that 6.101 counted as a Course VI department lab as motivation for taking the course.\r\n	  Problem sets in 6.101 were relatively simple.  Collaboration was not required to complete them, and they did not take very much time to finish.  In addition, problem sets were good practice and useful for understanding concepts.\n	Labs are described by many students as the heart of the course and where the majority of learning takes place in 6.101.  The labs are intensive and take a lot of time.  As a result, some students felt that they did not have enough time to adequately digest the material.  The lab equipment was reliable and both the professor and TA were available to help with debugging.\r\n	Grades consisted of five problem sets (10%), two quizzes (15%), six labs (25%), and a design project (50%).	Students rarely used the textbook, &quot;Electronic Circuit Design and Analysis&quot; by Neaman.  In contrast, the class notes were used extensively, and described as both plentiful and useful.  Some students noted that class notes were often disorganized.\r\n\r\n\r\n	Quizzes in 6.101 were fair and straightforward.  They drew heavily from problem sets and labs in 6.101.  Therefore, a student who understands the labs should expect the exams to be not very difficult.\n\n\n	"I learned a lot about analog circuits in this class."\r\n\r\n"[6.101 consists of] colorful wires and many nights spent on 6th floor in building 38 with the rest of the class."

It is a chance to remember why you came to MIT: to learn and to build cool systems.  We study the design and construction of\r\npower electronic circuits and motor drives.  Laboratory exercises include the construction of drive circuit for an electric go-cart, flash strobes, computing power supplies, three-phase inverters for AC motors, and resonant drives for\r\nlamp ballasts and induction heating.  We examine basic electric machines including DC, induction, and permanent magnet motors. As a member of this\r\nclass, you'll complete a sequence of assigned projects, followed by a final project of your choice, emphasizing creativity and uniqueness.\r\n\r\nThe overarching goal of this class is to share with you the skills and techniques that designers use to make useful systems that solve problems for\r\npeople.  These are the skills that will make you successful in an engineering career.  They empower you to see the value of analysis techniques you have learned.   Your experience in this class will teach you to use analytical methods to constrain problems in ways that lead to winning solutions and\r\nanswers that make your UROP project successful, that make your thesis work, that make your product a commercial success, that let you stand flat-footed in front of a problem and fight to win. Power electronic circuits are the backbone of almost every modern convenience. Automobiles, cell-phones, laptop and desktop computers,\r\ntelevision sets, and kitchen appliances, among many other systems, require power electronics\r\ncircuits to convert electrical energy to a useful form. The creation of a successful power electronic circuit almost always requires more than the application of a set of analytical techniques. The most elegant examples are crafted by engineers who have a rich understanding of how to make trade-offs amongst all the parts of a system, e.g,, thermal, mechanical, electrical, and sometimes software.  For this reason, we make special efforts to expose you to a huge number of demonstrations developed from a wide range of engineering disciplines, and to provide exciting laboratory experiences that let you try the techniques you learn on practical hardware.	The course focuses on building power-efficient electronics. The subject is taught in a hands-on manner through a wide variety of applications explored in the various lab projects. Although the focus is on specific applications, the necessary electrical theory is also covered in the course.	Professor Leeb's Lectures\nLab projects	Workload\nTime Commitment\nDebugging	Most students took this class to fulfill an Institute or Department lab requirement. Some wanted more practical experience with electronics while others wanted to take a class with Professor Leeb.	There were no problem sets.	Although they take a long time and are difficult to debug, the labs are essential for learning and understanding the course concepts. Students were impressed with the lab equipment they were able to use and the diversity of projects they were able to work on.	Students thought the grading was fair and felt completing the labs was necessary to getting a good grade in the class.	Class notes are useful and covered most concepts students needed to know.	The one quiz was fair and relevant to the course. Students felt the quiz was rather easy.	"We learned how to make a lot of cool stuff, with primary focus on power and efficiency."\r\n\r\n"Professor Leeb is an amazing instructor.

Problem sets are MATLAB intensive and take a while to debug, but generally useful.	The term project was fun and reinforced learning.  It was a also a way to review the course content for the semester.	The grading policy was transparently designed to help students learn the material and not based on a curve.	The two textbooks for the class were &quot;Diode Lasers and Photonic Integrated Circuits”  by Coldren and Corzine and “Physics of Optoelectronic Devices,” by Chuang.  Students tended not to use the textbooks, as the class notes were sufficient.	The midterm quiz was relevant and tested the basic material covered in class. The quiz was more qualitative than the problem sets, as it did not require MATLAB programming.	"End-of-year-project is one of the most important learning tools, great experience!!!"	Students wanted the problem sets to be graded and returned somehow, so that they could receive feedback. They also requested solutions to problem sets.		f	f	DCS	12	0	\N	\N	\N

The subject prepares students for research in hearing and related fields.\n\nGiven that they are interested in the material, MIT Seniors, and especially Juniors, should enroll in the subject.\n\nMy teaching in the subject conveys three things: a background in the perceptual science of hearing; a discussion the problems and techniques used to measure hearing, including elementary statistics; and a presentation of relevant auditory physiology.\n\nStudents may collaborate in all aspects of the subject but they must write up their own work (problem sets and laboratory assignments). The use of bibles is discouraged.\n\nThe subject is taught somewhat differently each time it is offered.

It is also an\nexcellent finishing subject for those that want a view into the world of\nmicroelectronics.\n\nThe concepts that I would like students to keep are that one can\nunderstand circuits and their operation from the basic physics if you\nconstruct simple models that capture the behavior over the range of\noperating conditions.  Also that approximation and gaining an intuitive\nunderstanding of device and circuit operation is the key to design.\n\nI allow collaboration on design projects in groups of two, but it is not\nrequired.  I am happy for students to work on homework together as long\nas they state on the PSET who they worked with and turn in their own\nwork.  (i.e. don't just divide up the work).\n\nI may reduce the content.  I am trying to figure out what material\nshould be removed.	Most of the material concerned semiconductor device behavior, including MOSFETs, BJTs, and diodes, and their implementation in silicon.  The last section of the class dealt with using these components in IC design, specifically the in the  analysis of amplifier circuits. Students said that the class was organized &quot;in a logical progression from the electron level to the circuit level.&quot;	Sodini's lectures\nOpen book tests\nDesigning active circuits 	* Weblabs\n* Emphasis on formulas\n* Mandatory lecture attendance	Most students took the class because it was a header for 6-1.  Many were interested in learning how transistors work, and heard the class was useful for later design work.	The problem sets were considered generally useful for learning the material, but repetitive and boring.  Many students recommended collaborating.	The weblabs were disliked by many students, requiring lots of time and contributing little to their learning.  The design project got mixed reviews: tedious, but with purpose.  Students felt a sense of accomplishment in using SPICE for design analysis, but would have found a tutorial on its use to be helpful.	Grading was distributed between two quizzes (15% each), the final exam (35%), homework (10%), design problem and web labs (15%).  The last 10% came from attendance, which was tracked at lectures and recitations.  Some students thought that there was too little partial credit, and did not find problem set graders to be timely or to provide useful comments.	The textbook (&quot;Microelectronics: An Integrated Approach&quot;, Howe and Sodini) was considered very helpful, and provided more detail than the lecture topics. The lecture notes were organized and concise, and helped students recognize which concept and formulas were most important to understand.	Exams were open-book and open-notes.  They were considered tough but fair, and went beyond formulas to test conceptual understanding.  Students recommended collecting important equations and constants before each exam.  Some found the exams hard to prepare for because there were few past exams or review packets available.	"Sodini's teaching saved this course."	Students wished that they had more time for weblabs and design projects, and that weblabs and design projects weren't due on the same weeks as normal problem sets.	http://mit.edu/6.012/	t	f	DCS	12	4	\N	\N	\N

Students general found the psets to be easy, but useful for learning the material. Some problems were tricky, though recitation presented helpful strategies to solve problems. Students felt that having to type psets in Latex made them take much longer than would have otherwise been necessary.	There is no lab component for this course.	Students found the exam grading to be fair, but felt that pset grading was fairly inconsistent between the two graders.	The book by Michael Sipser was unanimously acclaimed by the students who found it to be very clearly written with well-presented examples. There were no class notes.	The exams were straightforward and reasonable if students do the psets and understand the material. Some found the tests to be like pattern-matching from previously presented problems and techniques.	"You will definitely understand the problem 'Does P=NP?' after taking this course."\n"This is kind of the dumb-down version of 18.404."	The lectures could be made shorter -- 1.5 drags on.

Since students have varying degrees of past experiences in these areas, and because we present and build upon basic material, we recognize that some students may find parts of the course frustrating, and, on occasion, seemingly patronizing. However, no matter the experience level, there is always room to improve. This is an unusual class in that the course's objective is to provide guidance and feedback as students complete the various assignments (rather than to teach a specific body of technical knowledge). Students get out of the class what they put into these assignmentes, and we invite them to 1) take the initiative to create custom value for themselves, 2) use the materials, exercises and assignments to experiment, 3) improve their abilities in these important skills, and 4) develop their own personal style. We hope that students take the time to use 6.UAT as an opportunity to experiment and hone their skills -- an activity better done now, in a supportive environment with little consequence, as opposed to later, when mistakes can be professionally costly. The course is continually evolving, and we welcome input and suggestions for improvement. Finally, although not required, it is helpful if students have a thesis project or potential project topic in mind when starting the class.	This class taught communication skills in the real world with emphasis on delivering presentation.  Students practiced applying those skills through assignments and got feedback for improvement.  The course covered topics such as engaging the audience, &quot;stage presence&quot;, networking, ethics, negotiation.

This is a core first-year graduate subject for Area I and\nparts of Area II in EECS. It is also designed to serve a broader\ncommunity outside of EECS in science and engineering that encounter\nsuch problems in their research. This subject is designed for graduate\nstudents--and hence not a good match for undergraduates. What we\nreally require is a fluency with basic applied probability. Some\nmathematical maturity also helps. The goal is to introduce students to\na way of thinking about (and framework for) statistical inference\nproblems. Ultimately, we hope that the subject will lead students to\nmaking information measures an integral part of their toolbox for\nanalysis of inference problems.\n	This class was a thorough introduction to information theory and statistical inference. More emphasis was put on theory than on applications and opinions were divided about whether the application part was sufficient or not.

Many students collaborated, but as the course was only offered once before, no bibles were used.	None	Grading policy seemed fair in general, but little partial credit was given.	Many students complained that this class should have more organized class notes and more relevant textbooks (some recommended Cover and Thomas' book as the textbook). Personal notes taken from lectures were very helpful.	Exams required thorough understanding of concepts and they were significantly time-constrained; 2 hours were given for quizzes that were intended to take 90 minutes. They were slightly easier than psets but required more insight and speed. Some students suggested that there be more practice exams or questions.	"Tests were graded with little to no partial credit awarded, even on long questions where later parts built on earlier parts and some errors could cascade."	Almost every student complained that there should be a better, more relevant textbook and lecture notes. Several students recommended Elements of Information Theory by Cover and Tomas. Some students said this class covers too much and lacks practical examples. One student said an information theory course should be specified as a prerequisite. Another student commented that recitations and office hours should be improved to better help students rather than just helping homework assignments.		f	f	\N	12	\N	\N	\N	\N

Students learn techniques of optical, electron, and ion-beam microscopy and lithography, and methods of materials deposition, etching, and analysis. The course emphasis is on fundamental concepts and developing an intuitive understanding of the science that underlies nanoscale fabrication.	6.781J/2.391J covered research techniques in microscopy and lithography for nanofabrication.  It covered a wide range of topics providing a good balance between application and theory.  Students commented that this class is useful for would-be researchers interested in a survey of available techniques in the area of nanofabrication.

However, most comments suggested that only students who are doing research in this area should take this class, since it may be painful for students who are not extremely motivated.	There was a general consensus that the problem sets were poorly designed and did not help in solidifying concepts learned in class.  Many students found the problem sets to be a waste of time; common complaints included: (1) Ambiguity of the questions, requiring students to make a lot of assumptions. (2) Too much focus on material that was not covered in lecture.\n\nSome students collaborated on the problem sets and found it helpful.	No labs.	Students generally felt the grading policy was strict but fair, although the ambiguity of many questions led to several disagreements and students felt more partial credit should have been awarded.  In addition, many students complained about the extremely rigid late homework policy.  Problem sets had to be submitted before the class began, which penalized students heavily for being even a minute late for class. 	There was no textbook.  The instructors provided a set of class notes.  Students found the class notes useful in understanding the material; however they also wished the notes were clearer and more helpful on the problem sets.	There were no quizzes, only a take-home final examination.	"You learn everything you need from reading the notes and I found the Psets a waste of time."	Students suggested making the problem sets clearer and more relevant to lecture material, as well as making the lateness and grading policies more flexible.	http://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/6/sp07/6.781/index.html	f	f	DCS	12	0	\N	\N	\N

These problems include resource allocation, traffic engineering and management, performance and scalability, security, availability, and the delivery of advanced services such as virtual private networks (VPNs) and multicast. Technical challenges affected by economic or policy issues such as network neutrality are also be discussed. \n\nTwo papers are assigned for reading prior to most classes, drawing on both academic publications and other materials such as books written by industry practitioners. Most of the work for the class consists of reading these papers and participating in discussion; class participation is a key part of the final grade.\n\nStudents should have a good grasp of basic computer networking concepts before taking this class as the topics covered are quite advanced. The class is likely to be of most interest to students who want to pursue a career in networking or a related field, and who want to understand how the research in networking relates to the &amp;quot;real world&amp;quot; problems faced in large operational networks. 	By reading and discussing papers, students became acquainted with cutting-edge technologies related to internet networking service. To participate in the discussions, students should already be familiar with networking concepts like MPLS.  	Anecdotes\nDiscussion	Unstructured discussion\nLack of introductory material\nCisco-centric worldview\nToo much reading in the final week	Some students came to learn about how networking services really work in industry.

This subject covers:  Diodes, Transistors, Junction Field-Effect Transistors, Operational Amplifiers; basic analog circuit design as applied to audio and radio frequency circuits.\nStudents spend the second half of the term designing and building their own projects.\n\n2.  This class is an Elective.  Students should take it to learn analog circuits and circuit design, to participate in a group design project that simulates design practices in industry, or to satisfy the MIT or the EECS Department Lab requirement; to work with expert analog engineers from local analog companies.\nSeveral graduate students have taken this course to get background for research work.\n\n3.  Students who want to learn analog circuits and who like hands-on lab work should take 6.101.  Also, those who would like to work closely with the instructor and local analog engineers from industry on design projects. \n\nA student needs to understand the basic principles of electronic circuit analysis well, i. e. 6.002 or equivalent.\n\n4.  My teaching philosophy is to minimize mathematical transfer functions and solutions and to emphasize visual and intuitive circuit understanding; to create a practical and useful design experience.  In the process, students will learn to understand and use a wide variety of analog circuits.  They will learn how to use books, periodicals, and websites to find circuit ideas and to supplement their textbook knowledge.  Additionally, 6.101 is supported during the project phase by engineers from local analog companies.  These engineers come to MIT to help students with their projects in person, as well as providing assistance via phone and e-mail.\n\n5.  Collaboration, etc.:  The six laboratory exercises are individual efforts.  Parts of each lab are changed each term.  Problem sets are individual efforts.  The projects are group projects [teams of 3] but each person contributing to the project is graded individually.\n\n6.  The WWW:  staff limitations have made it difficult to make the large volume of materials for 6.101 available on the web. I would rather see the TA spend time in lab helping students than spend time preparing class materials to post on the web.  However, the web is used extensively to get device specifications from semiconductor manufacturers, to find circuit design ideas, and to order parts for projects.  \n\n7.  Changes:  next term I hope to add Bose Corporation to the other three companies who are involved with 6.101:  Analog Devices, Linear Technology, and Silicon Labs.\n	6.101 was an institute lab meant to teach the design and analysis of analog circuits.  Emphasis is placed on intuition as opposed to equations.  Theory is mentioned, but the labs - the focus of the course - introduce plenty in the way of applications.

Also, it satisfies a course 6 requirement for 6-1 and 6-2.	Psets were pretty straightforward and easy compared to labs. 	Although very time-consuming, the labs are the most crucial part of this course and essential to learning the material.  A significant portion of labtime was spent debugging circuits.	Grading was fair and very generous - it was A-/A centered.	Both textbooks were clear and helpful, but were not followed closely by the course. Class notes were good for reference.

Since students have varying degrees of past experiences in these areas, and because we present and build upon basic material, we recognize that some students may find parts of the course frustrating, and, on occasion, seemingly patronizing. However, no matter the experience level, there is always room to improve. This is an unusual class in that the course's objective is to provide guidance and feedback as students complete the various assignments (rather than to teach a specific body of technical knowledge). Students get out of the class what they put into these assignmentes, and we invite them to 1) take the initiative to create custom value for themselves, 2) use the materials, exercises and assignments to experiment, 3) improve their abilities in these important skills, and 4) develop their own personal style. We hope that students take the time to use 6.UAT as an opportunity to experiment and hone their skills -- an activity better done now, in a supportive environment with little consequence, as opposed to later, when mistakes can be professionally costly. The course is continually evolving, and we welcome input and suggestions for improvement. Finally, although not required, it is helpful if students have a thesis project or potential project topic in mind when starting the class.	Many felt that UAT really gave them a lot of opportunities to practice and perfect presentation skills.  The assignments helped them gain confidence speaking in front of people.  However many who were already good at speaking didn't think they learned much from this class.  There were a couple lectures on negotiation.  Most agreed that the skills taught in this class are useful in the real world.	Tony Eng's lectures\nSmall recitations and group interactions\nLots of practice presenting\nNegotiation\nConcept Talk for high school students	Mandatory lecture attendance\nTime devoted to actually making the presentations (slides, etc.)\n	Although students had to take this class because it is a Course VI requirement, most people ended up enjoying it and recommend going in with an open mind and a positive attitude.	The frequent presentation assignments were very useful practice and forced one to prepare and improve.  Many found making the presentations to be more time consuming than expected.  The writing assignments in the beginning of the term were useless.	No labs.	Because of the nature of the class, the grading seemed somewhat subjective.  However it did take into account the amount of improvement and effort in addition to the quality of the presentation.  While most people found the grading to be reasonable and fair, a sizable minority found it unclear and arbitrary.  Class averages were not posted so it was hard to compare one's standing.  Grading also varied with recitation instructor.	No readings.	No quizzes.	"Not finding a thesis in the first 5 weeks of senior year means you are doomed to work on automobile technologies for the rest of your life."\n"I learned how to crank out good presentations much more quickly than I used to be able to."	The last guest presentation on statistics seemed totally irrelevant.  Maybe structure the assignments around presentation techniques instead of topic. \nA couple students felt that the Previous Project Talk was done too many times. Also, the ethics debate should be revised, maybe have one debate topic only.  Negotiation lecture was good and should be kept.	https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.UAT/info.php#apolicy	f	f	core	6	\N	\N	\N	The objective of the class was clear: improving one's presentation skills.  The class met the objective, although a few were not confident about the outcomes.  One must keep practicing the skills to retain them.

This subject was a continuation of 6.01 in introducing aspects of EECS to new Course-6 students. The topics were mainly focused on analog/digital signal transmission, bit transmission, and networks. Many students viewed the class as a great introduction with good balance between theoretical and hand-on components of course 6.

Many found bibles to be very helpful in solving the problem sets.	There were three components of labs in the class: prelabs, labs, and exit interviews with LAs. Labs were viewed in general as helpful in learning. Also, many students thought that the length and difficulty of the labs were reasonable. However, a small number of students commented that some labs (and/or prelabs) were lengthy and that debugging python code was frustrating.	The grading was fair. Also, having grades posted on the course website was helpful for students to keep track of their progress in the class.	Since there was no textbook for the class, students relied on the class notes as their main reference. Many thought the notes were inadequately detailed and not overly helpful.	The course had weekly mini-quizzes in addition to two big quizzes and a final.\n\nMini-quizzes were usually very time-limited (10 minutes), so some student thought of it as a harrowing experience but others did not think it was unreasonably hard if you understood the concepts well. Quizzes were widely viewed as fair with quiz 1 being particularly hard compared with other quizzes.	"You should take the class because it gives you an idea of what Course 6 can be."	There is a widespread demand for better reference source or formal textbook that would clearly explain course's material to them.\n\nHaving ore TAs and LAs for the class is suggested since it is viewed by many that the lab does not have enough teachers to engage in every student's work.\n\nThe difficulty of the first module (Fourier transform) is also another source of frustration by students.

However, many students were also interested in taking an introductory electrical engineering class and felt that it was a useful class in general.  	The problem sets were useful for learning material, despite having some tedious algebra and conceptually difficult questions.  Most students felt that the iLab questions did not contribute to their learning.  Some students collaborated because the problem sets often required significant amounts of time to complete.  	Most students enjoyed the final lab, which was the only hands-on lab in the course, and felt that it provided a good reinforcement of the material that had been taught throughout the semester.  Faulty lab equipment often made debugging unnecessarily time-consuming.  The iLabs were disliked, and many students thought that having more hands-on labs would have been better.  	Some students felt that the grading policy was fair.  Others thought that too much weight was placed on exams, which were graded too harshly with very little partial credit.  	There was a textbook, which was comprehensive and useful.  Some students found the textbook very dense, which made it difficult to extract relevant information. Most students found the lecture notes to be very useful, although some thought they lacked detail. 	There were three one-hour exams, and many students felt that they were more difficult than the problem sets.

This subject covers: Resonant circuits and control of the associated bandwidth; Diodes, Transistors, Junction Field-Effect Transistors, Operational Amplifiers; basic analog circuit design as applied to audio and radio frequency circuits.\nStudents spend the second half of the term designing and building their own projects.\n\nThis course satisfies both the EECS Dept. and the Institute Lab requirements.\n\n2.  This class is an Elective.  Students should take it to learn analog circuits and circuit design, to participate in a group design project that simulates design practices in industry, or to satisfy the MIT or the EECS Department Lab requirement; to work with expert analog engineers from local analog companies.\nSeveral graduate students have taken this course to get background for research work.\n\n3.  Students who want to learn analog circuits and who like hands-on lab work should take 6.101.  Also, those who would like to work closely with the instructor and local analog engineers from industry on design projects. Many students from courses 2, 8, 16, 18, 22 find this course useful.\n\nA student needs to understand the basic principles of electronic circuit analysis well, i. e. 6.002 or equivalent such as 6.071.\n\n4.  My teaching philosophy is to minimize mathematical transfer functions and solutions and to emphasize visual and intuitive circuit understanding; to create a practical and useful design experience.  In the process, students will learn to understand and use a wide variety of analog circuits.  They will learn how to use books, periodicals, and websites to find circuit ideas and to supplement their textbook knowledge.  Additionally, 6.101 is supported during the project phase by engineers from local analog companies.  These engineers come to MIT to help students with their projects in person, as well as providing assistance via phone and e-mail.\n\n5.  Collaboration, etc.:  The six laboratory exercises are individual efforts.  Parts of each lab are changed each term.  Problem sets are individual efforts.  The projects are group projects [teams of 3] but each person contributing to the project is graded individually.\n\n6.  The WWW:  staff limitations have made it difficult to make the large volume of materials for 6.101 available on the web. I would rather see the TA spend time in lab helping students than spend time preparing class materials to post on the web.  However, the web is used extensively to get device specifications from semiconductor manufacturers, to find circuit design ideas, and to order parts for projects.  \n\n7.  The following companies are now supporting 6.101:  Analog Devices Inc., The Bose Corporation, Linear Technology Corporation, Intersil, and Silicon Labs.	6.101 covered topics such as electrical resonance, rectification, transistors, opamps, and BJTs. There is little about theory, the class is all application. Students learned a lot about analog circuit design and found it to be a fun and good class.	Professor Roscoe \nLabs\nDesign Project\n	Quizzes\nLong labs\nNo website\nTime consuming	Students took this class to learn more about analog circuit design and gain more experience in the lab. It was an intense EE class and also fulfilled a lab and CI-M requirements. 	Problem sets were fairly simple and provided a good review. They made students more familiar with practical circuit design questions. Not much collaboration was required.	Labs were where most of the learning took place. They were very long. The lab equipment was reliable with very few exceptions. The open-ended design project at the end of the class gave students the chance to demonstrate what they had learned. Also, working with industry engineers for the design project was a very good experience. Students suggested starting labs very early and listening carefully to everything said in lecture for hints as to how to solve possible problems that appear in lab.	Grading was fair: 25% final project demonstration, 25% final project paper, ~25% labs, ~25% (2 exams + homework).	The class notes were very helpful, especially as there was no website. The textbook also helped and had good examples.	The quizzes were harder than problem sets, but were fair assessments. Looking back over class handouts and notes was important.	"The final projects are a great way to meet industry folk and get some networking done."	Students really thought a website would be helpful.	http://web.mit.edu/6.101/www/	f	t	none	12	12	\N	\N	There were objectives that were met.

There was a good blend of computer science and electrical engineering topics that were covered.  Computer science topics included basic algorithms, searching, state machines, and object-oriented programming (in python).  Electrical engineering topics include signals and systems, and circuits.

This class is a good intro to course VI, so anyone interested in pursuing this major should take 6.01.	The online tutor problems were relevant and useful for learning the material.  Most people found that they were on the easy side, and did not collaborate or use bibles.  The problems were reasonable in length.  The online tutor would let students check whether their small bits of code worked before they submitted the whole answer.	Students found both the design labs and software labs interesting and of adequate length.  However, many felt that the documentation and explanation was not adequate.  Many found the labs frustrating at times, yet satisfying afterward.	The grading scale was well-publicized.  Most students found it fair.	Class notes were extremely useful.  They covered the same material as the handouts given in lecture, but in more depth.  The class did not have a textbook.	There were nanoquizzes and exams.  The weekly nanoquizzes were time limited--students were given 15 minutes on them.  They were given before design lab, and some students found them very stressful. They encouraged students to learn the material on time.  The students found the exams to be fair and of average difficulty.

Coding theory is the mathematical study of methods to correct errors in computation or communication. Essentiality refers to the fact that only the most elementary methods are covered, and only those that are motivated by their asymptotic or algorithmic significance. \n\nContents of the course includes modelling of the error-correction problem via error-correcting codes. Existential, universal and constructive bounds on codes. Algorithms for encoding and decoding. Connections to other aspects of CS/math.\n\nThis is an advanced graduate subject. Students in CS theory, communication theory, and discrete mathematics would benefit from the course - they would learn about a wide collection of tools available to design/analyze error-correcting codes. These tools turn out to be similar to those used in many other aspects of CS/math and so students could benefit broadly from learning about them.\n\nStudents taking this class should be mathematically confident. Prior exposure to at least one CS/math graduate level course (e.g. 6.840) would help.\n\nThe main philosophy is that a few very simple techniques combine to give a wide variety of strong results in coding theory, and that these techniques are generally useful. Students that take the course with a genuine interest to learn new stuff will find the material very useful later in their research paths.\n\nCollaboration is highly encouraged.

The prerequisites are: curiosity about random processes, patience with subtlety, attention to detail, and a drive to really understand what certain subtle results really mean. The essential background is a thorough understanding of 6.431 or 6.041, (i.e., the basics of Bertsekas and Tsitsiklis, Introduction to Probability, 2nd ed, or equivalent). But 6.262 does not require a profound background in pure mathematics, since measure theory is not used.\n\nThe course teaches convergence of random variables, the Poisson process, renewal processes, finite and infinite Markov chains, continuous-time Markov chains, random walks and martingales. Queues and other simple applications are emphasized. It does not focus on statistics, information theory or inference. The material is essential for research students in communications, operations research and other areas that emphasize stochastic processes and stochastic modelling. The homeworks are somewhat long and demanding, because thinking through the homework yourself is the main event in this course. It is the best way to learn the material.

Applications are drawn from aerospace, mechanical, electrical, and chemical engineering, biology, and materials science. Topics include mathematical formulations (techniques for automatic assembly of mathematical problems from physics' principles); sparse, direct and iterative solution techniques for linear systems; Newton methods for nonlinear problems; discretization methods for ordinary, time-periodic and partial differential equations; accelerated methods for integral equations; techniques for dynamical system model reduction.\n\nPrerequisites are some Calculus and Ordinary Differential Equations (e.g. 18.03). In addition any previous Linear Algebra (e.g. 18.06) will be very useful, although all the required linear algebra concepts will be reviewed in class with emphasis on their physical interpretation. Some basic knowledge of MATLAB can also be useful, although introductory tutorial sessions will be offered for students without previous experience.\n\nThe core teaching philosophy is 'learning by doing'. Most of the learning of the material will occur while trying to solve the problem sets. Problem sets typically consist of implementation of the algorithms discussed in class on example applications. Often we provide code infrastructure such as parsers or non-optimized core numerical code. Students can then simply focus on the development or improvement of the core numerical algorithm. Creative solutions are strongly encouraged and never penalized.\nStudents are strongly encouraged to work in small groups. Every student is however required to write their own code and report. Final grades are mainly based on effort on problem sets and are not curved.\n\nCompared to other numerical simulation classes, this class will focus significantly more on practical aspects, such as on how to assemble automatically a system to be solved from first principle laws. A second a fundamental difference is that this class will dedicate a substantial attention also to numerical techniques that can be used on extremely large problems.	The course covered numerical simulation and numerically solving linear and non-linear systems. Students generally thought there was a good balance between theory and application, although a stronger connection could have been drawn between them.	Professor Daniel\nNo exams\nEffort-based grading scheme	Long, difficult assignments\nSlow problem set grading	Most students took the course because it satisfied a core requirement for their degree or they were interested in applying the subject material to research or another real-world problem.	Problem sets were long and difficult, but almost all students thought they were extremely useful for learning the course material. Some students thought that they learned everything in the course from the problem sets. Most students worked alone or in small groups, which they considered helpful.	There were no labs.	The grading in the class was effort-based and considered by most students to be relatively fair. The graders were sometimes slow returning the homework which made it hard for the students to know how they were doing in the class.	The only readings were the class notes, which were useful but sometimes not very clear or organized. Students felt that they had to attend lecture in order to understand what the notes were trying to demonstrate.	No comments.

Students take this course either to help them in their research (finding new problems to work on, or finding tools to solve problems), or out of curiosity. \n\nStudents taking this course should have sufficient mathematical maturity - i.e., the ability to separate proofs from vague arguments and the ability to turn the latter into the former whenever possible. Students should be interested in algorithmic complexity.\n\nThe teaching philosophy for the course is simple: We pick results that seem exciting and surprising,\nwhere the proofs can fit into one/two lectures and cover them. The main concept that I'd like students to retain is that a very diverse collection of notions about behavior of &amp;amp;quot;intelligent&amp;amp;quot; entities (human/computers) can be modelled mathematically and analyzed. I'd also like students to remember that not every &amp;amp;quot;intuitively&amp;amp;quot; obvious statement about such phenomena is true (probabilistically checkable proofs offer a good example). \n\nStudents are encouraged to work collaboratively. Extra office hours are arranged before problem sets are due to encourage this.\n\nNext time I teach this course, I hope to have a room that will fit the class (this term, the room was too small and all alternates were in bad condition).	This class covers modern complexity theory, focusing on results of the last 30 years. Topics included many complexity classes and their relationships with each other, and covers techniques used in this field.	Sudan's lectures\nInteresting material	Impossible problem sets\n	Most students took the class because they were interested in complexity theory, or because they enjoyed 6.840.	The three problem sets were challenging, but essential to learning the material.  Problems were chosen well and had interesting results.  Many students collaborated.	The final project involved selecting, summarizing, and presenting an academic paper.  Students enjoyed this assignment.	Students found the grading policy to be fair, and liberal, but also commented that there was &quot;almost zero feedback&quot; from the class.	Scribe notes were taken by students, and were posted promptly, but were not always useful.  Several students recommended that those notes be adapted from previous years, to build on prior work.

Students found the class notes to be very thorough if a bit rough around the edges; Those students who chose to use the 6.003 textbook for this course found it useful.	The exams were fair and were similar in difficulty to problem sets. 	This class teaches you several different topics in communication, signal processing, and control. There is a large focus on state space models and estimation. The class is mostly theoretical with some applications and demos thrown in. \n\nLike a swarm of locusts, mathematical formulas engulf the poor students taking the class. As the students slowly are picked apart by abstract mathematics locusts (mo' like loci), the student would cry, "Instructors! Save us with some applications, so that we may have a better intuition of what all of these abstract objects are!" But the cry fell on deaf ears. The course instructors would not listen to the cries of the class. Applications were for peasants, or Caltech students! Not for members of MIT's elite 6.011 Spring 2010 class! Eventually, the cries of the students faded into silence, and they accepted their fate.	Varied suggestions were given; the most popular suggestions were to give more of an overview of how the details of the course fit in with the larger picture, and to explain more thoroughly how course theory was applied in the real world. 	http://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/6/sp10/6.011/index.html	t	f	none	12	0	\N	\N	All students felt that the objectives were clear; however they were not achieved, as the class fell two weeks behind schedule; students generally were not bothered by this, however.

The course material is chosen to give a solid base for research in photonics.  Senior undergraduate and MEng students with emphasis in electromagnetics and photonics should take this class, in addition to incoming graduate students interested in photonics (Optics and Quantum Electronics) from all departments.  Before taking this class, students should have a basic understanding of electromagnetism.  In this class, physical principles and mathematical concepts are used multiple times to explain and to quantitatively analyze a broad variety of optical and opto-electronic phenomena.  Ideally, students will take from this class: the equivalence between dispersion relations and wave equations, dispersion, diffraction and quantum mechanical uncertainty of a free particle;  \ncoupled modes in space and time to understand integrated optical devices and coherent interaction of light and matter; the physical meaning of basic spectroscopic quantities like interaction cross section, decoherence and energy relaxation; and basic laser operation and dynamics.  Students are encouraged to work on assignments together. A limited number of hand written as well as by staff prepared formula sheets are allowed to be used at quizzes and finals.	Students thought that this class had a lot of breadth; it covered most of the topics anyone getting into optics research would need to know. However, because of the amount of topics it covered, some students thought it didn't go as deep into the material as one would want. The class also used lots of labs and examples to show applications of the theory, which many students found helped them to relate the subject of photonics to actual lab research.	Lots of applications\nMotivation of up-to-date research	Powerpoint lectures\nLong exams	Students took this class because it was applicable to their current or future research. Most people were already interested in learning about photonics.	The problem sets were challenging and helped students to learn the material. Most were calculation heavy, but fair.	N/A	All students thought that the grading was fair. Students had the option of doing no homework, which can be easier on your workload but makes tests harder (especially since they aren't buffered by problem set grades).	There was no textbook, but the lecturer shared parts of a book he is currently writing on the subject. The class notes were good for reviewing the material, but not for actual learning; they were more so outlines than in-depth explanations of derivations.	The quizzes were long and difficult, similar to the problem sets.	"This course felt more like a survey subject than an in-depth exploration of any one area."\n\n"It's clear that it's intended as a gateway toward a field of research, but felt that it was trying to do a bit too much."	The students thought that lectures should go more into an explanation of the flow of the derivations instead of just reading the equations. Also, they thought the tests needed to be shorter or they should have more time to take the tests.	http://stuff.mit.edu/afs/sipb/project/course-search/web_scripts/search/urls-sp10/stellar.6.602.html	f	f	OEE	12	\N	\N	\N	The students thought the objectives were laid out clearly in the syllabus.

We cover deterministic and stochastic signal processing, image processing, and statistical inference. This elective is of interest to students who want opportunities for hands-on application of signal processing techniques and experience with real-world biomedical problems. Students should take this course to prepare for work in an academic or commercial environment where they will need to analyze biomedical signals and/or medical images. Our goal is to give students a toolbox and the knowledge of when to use each tool so that they have skills to approach new problems/applications with signal processing techniques appropriate to their current problem/application. Lectures provide theoretical material and background on physiological and medical systems, as well as real-world examples from guest lecturers working in the field. Labs are done with partners but written up independently. Partners may share figures, Matlab code, and ideas but not the text of lab reports. Group work is okay for homework problem sets. 6.003 or equivalent is required as a prerequisite. Familiarity with probability and statistics is helpful. The class can be taken before or after 6.011/6.341 as it gives practical aspects of some theoretical topics covered in those courses.

Although the problem sets were long, most students found them useful for learning the material and fairly graded. 	Most labs were of a reasonable length. Some students felt that the motor labs were not particularly useful for learning the material; however, most enjoyed the final design project, and felt that it synthesized the concepts from the course. 	Students felt that the grading was fair overall.	There was no textbook for this course, but students found Kent Lundberg's course notes very useful. 	There was one midterm and one take-home exam for this course. Students felt that the midterm was difficult but fair, although some wished that there wasn't as much of a time crunch on the exam. The take-home exam focused mostly on the labs.	"I felt by the end of the course that I had learned valuable tools for characterizing a system and designing compensators."\n"This is probably THE most useful class I've taken at MIT."\n	Some students wished that there weren't as many weeks with at least two assignments due; they would have preferred to focus on one of the assignments at a time.

The projects were interesting and instrumental in reinforcing the class material, but were very broad and time consuming. 	For the most part, students seemed unsure of the grading policy or distribution. Students felt that grades were mostly high, but subjective.	The textbook was helpful for the pop quizzes.

The class taught concepts such as simple circuits, signals and systems, object-oriented programming, and state machines through the use of online tutor problems and in-class software and design labs. Students felt that a great deal of content was taught over the course of the semester and that because of the broad depth, the course could not go into as much depth in some of the material as students would have liked. Students also felt that the course sometimes leaned too much in one direction than the other (EE vs CS or vice versa).	Robots\nDesign labs\nHelpful TAs\nOnline tutor	Nanoquizzes and exams\nStrict grade cutoffs\nCrowded office hours\nHeavy workload	Most students took it since it is a required course for Course VI; others took it out of interest and a desire to learn programming.	This class had weekly online tutor assignments as well as occasional homework assignments. Many students felt that the homework assignments were long and time-consuming. However, students felt that the weekly tutor problems were helpful in learning the material and understanding concepts that were taught.	The class had in-class software and design labs that focused on programming and designing circuits for robots. Labs grew increasingly difficult as the class progressed, building upon past labs and new material learned. There were mixed opinions on the labs. Some students felt that the labs were very useful in learning and applying the material learned in class. However, students felt that the labs were too long and time-consuming, and many felt rushed to complete the labs in times for a checkoff. Randomly chosen partners as well as unforeseen technical issues often made completing the labs more frustrating than expected. 	There were mixed opinions on the grading of the class - many thought that the system was fair, whereas others thought that a cutoff of 90 for an A was too harsh.	Students felt the the class notes, available online, were very useful and covered the material that was taught in class. Some students would have liked the answers to the problems presented in the class notes to be made available as well.	There were nanoquizzes at the beginning of each design lab and midterms given in the evenings. Most students felt that the nanoquizzes were fair and simple enough. There were mixed opinions, however, on the midterms - some thought they were a fair assessment of the material taught, while others thought that they were too long and difficult, and did not reflect how well students actually understood the material as the labs did.	"I am now realizing just how useful the content is"\n"Robots. duuuh."\n"ROBOTS"	Students felt that exams could have been made shorter or they could have been given more time, as well as be more reflective of the material learned in class. Students also thought that at times the TA/LA to student ratio was too low, making checkoffs slow. Many would like the design labs/assignment wording to be made clearer.

Mike Stunes\nProjects\nProblem sets	Slow grading\nExams\nCourse administration	Students took this class mainly because it was a requirement for Course 6-3.	For greater understanding of concepts taught in lecture, there were four problem sets over the course of the semester.\n\nStudents felt that the problem sets were long and frustrating. There were mixed opinions on their usefulness - some felt that the problem sets were useful in learning the material, where others thought they were not. Some students also felt that the grading of problem sets was slow and poorly done.	There were no labs in this course, but there were two major projects, where students worked in teams of three to design, create specifications for, and implement a software system.\n\nStudents in general thought that the projects were interesting and useful in learning the course concepts, as well as learning how to work in groups. However, students felt that the projects required a lot of work and that performance was dependent on picking the right teammates.	Students felt the grading policy was not transparent. They felt that there was too much emphasis in their grades on code comments. Students thought that the autograder was prone to mistakes and at times unfair. Students also thought that grades were given out very late.	There were only lecture slides provided for the course, and students felt they were not very useful. However, students found that the notes from the previous semester were useful.	There were two exams given over the semester. Students felt that it was difficult to study for the exams, since there was not much correlation between what was taught and what was tested. Students also thought that the exams were long and had too many errors - many students missed the corrections mentioned during the exam, which affected their performance.	"MIKE STUNES IS THEBOMB.COM except not because that website is weird"\n"Learning how to program like a boss"	Students highly suggest that the class be more organized. Students also would have liked prompt feedback and grading on their assignments. Grading could also have been more transparent, and some students were frustrated by how much weight making comments had in their grade. The exams could have had more proofreading to avoid mistakes, as well as tailored to accurately reflect what students have learned in the class. Students also felt that having a project due right after spring break was detrimental to their performance, as teammates would sometimes be out of state and unable to work.

The first half of the course was focused on programming while the second half touched on more broadly applicable computer science concepts such as graphs and machine learning, without exploring them in depth. The course covered a large amount of material. Topics included algorithms, data analysis, simulation techniques, and the use of software libraries. Assignments were completed using the Python programming language, and were generally considered interesting.	Interesting problem sets\nWorking code\nCandy	Lectures\nHeavy workload\nExams	Most students took this class as an introduction to programming or Python, which led many to complain that the latter half of the course focused on more CS/math concepts such as machine learning and probability. This was particularly a complaint among non-CS majors for whom the class is required, like Course 20 students.	The assignments were interesting and helpful for learning the material, but were time consuming for those with no programming experience. The difficulty of the assignments also increased significantly as the semester progressed. Many students benefited from collaboration and attending office hours. A few complained that problem sets were assigned even during the week of an exam.	This course did not have labs.	The grade breakdown was 30% homework and 70% quiz. Grading was generally considered fair, and late days were a big plus. Grading on the quizzes was occasionally described as harsh, particularly in terms of partial credit.	One of the lecturers, Professor Guttag, had a textbook which was a work in progress and which students generally found useful. Opinions on the usefulness of the lecture notes varied wildly. A few remarked that it was better to learn from class notes than from lecture, while others found the notes to be an insufficient substitute for attending lecture. Some recommended using the online Python documentation while others considered the documentation hard to understand.	Quizzes were open book and covered material from the lectures but not the problem sets - in fact, several students felt that the problem sets did not help them prepare for the quizzes. Questions were tricky and required paying attention to detail. However, it was easy to do well if one had worked through past quizzes.	"When you finish the psets, you realize you've solved some really cool problems, and they're really applicable."\n\n"There is too much emphasis on unrelated concepts such as probability. This should be left for students to cover on their own rather than having several lectures spent on it."\n\n"Students eligible for 6.01 should not be permitted to take the class."	Students taking 6.00 had a wide range of prior programming ability, which was reflected in the comments. Some students felt that the problem sets were excessively long and the lectures hard to follow, while others considered the problem sets trivial and the lectures boring. Multiple students complained that their colleagues were overqualified to take the class and that this made that class unfair for those who were learning programming for the first time. A few also remarked that the latter half of the course, which covered concepts such as machine learning and probability, could have benefited by trading breadth for depth.

There were no problem sets for this class.	The lab exercises were intended to give students hands-on experience in designing digital systems. Each student completed a gate-level design for a RISC processor during the semester. Students found the labs interesting and useful in understanding the course material. Students also felt that the labs were generally long in length, especially the final beta project.	The grading scheme for this class was made clear at the beginning of the semester (all cutoffs were given). Students felt the grading policy was fair but felt that the cutoffs given were unfair due to the increased difficulty of the quizzes compared to past years.	There was no textbook for this class, but students thought that the lecture notes and online lecture videos were helpful.	Students felt the quizzes were overall difficult and inconsistent in format as well as difficulty, contrasting with past years. Practice quizzes in the form of past semesters' quizzes proved helpful for studying.	"The Terman-ator"	Students felt that the lab was understaffed and thus the checkoff queues were long, especially during peak hours when many students were trying to get checkoffs. Students also suggested that the due date of a lab and exam should not coincide, as it did with the third quiz.

Some students wished that there was a textbook for the course.	The one midterm was long and challenging, but fair.  The questions were on the same level as the problem sets.	"Everything is clear and intuitive."	Students asked that they be given more resources to references for the course.	http://web.mit.edu/6.376/www/	f	f	DCS	12	8	\N	\N	\N

Topics included approximation using Linear Time Invariant systems, state-space models, and feedback systems.  The class was heavy on theory but some students felt that this approach suited the class content.	Devoted course staff\r\nExamples	Confusing lectures\r\nConfusing readings	Most students wanted to expand their knowledge of control theory because it was important for their research.	Problem sets were very useful for understanding the material but difficult. Attending Prof. Megretski's office hours was recommended.	MATLAB problems were complex and difficult, but helpful.	Grading was fair to generous, and accurate.  Students also had opportunities to retake exams.  Grades were broken down into problem sets (30%), take-home quiz (30%), and two regular quizzes (40%).	Students found that the class notes are more relevant to the course material than the textbook, which was a draft of a text to be published in the future.  Some students found the textbook  inadequate. Reading Prof. Megretski's class notes was essential.	Quizzes were generally easier than the homework problems but drew directly from the homework material. Quiz questions tested concepts rather than the math required to solve the problem.  Students recommended preparing by doing past exams.	"The teaching staff is amazing! They devoted extreme amounts of office-hour time and personal meetings to the students. The lectures were very well thought-out with lots of explanations, proofs and illustrative examples."	Suggestions include teaching more basic concepts, and using more basic examples in lecture, even though they may be too simplistic. Making fewer assumptions about students' prior knowledge may also be useful. There is a request that background references be provided so that students can have a way to catch up if they don't understand a concept.		f	f	CCS	12	0	\N	\N	\N

Students who received less than a C in either of those courses do not have adequate preparation for 6.011. Parts of 6.011 can tend to look a lot like 6.003 and 6.041 revisited and to some extent are. However in revisiting and extending that material the student is now exposed to and held responsible for increased sophistication and depth of understanding that goes well beyond mechanical manipulation of the equations. Students who say &amp;quot;wake me up when we're done with the review&amp;quot; are often caught still napping by the first quiz. The lectures on state-space models require that students be comfortable with basic matrix manipulations and eigenvalue/eigenvector properties covered in 18.03 (and further developed in 18.06).  Regarding homework and collaboration, each student is asked at the beginning of the semester to choose between one of two options for the homework. In one option, homework is not handed in and is not graded (and of course not weighted in the final grade). With the second option, homework is handed in, graded, and weighted in the final grading. Collaboration on homework is permitted and encouraged, but students must list the collaborators on the homework.	6.011 was in introduction to signal processing and included topics such as transforms, DSP, feedback systems, estimation, and filters.  The class content matched student expectations and was described as an extension of 6.041 and 6.003.  The class relies heavily on theory and contained few applications.\r\n\r\n	Magic tricks!\r\nStaff\r\nAl Oppenheim\r\nMelanie Rudoy.	14 problem sets \r\nProblem sets during exam weeks\r\nToo much theory\r\nTime	Many students took this course out of an interest in signal processing and/or communications, and recommend it to others interested in this area. Many also took it because it is a header for 6-1 and 6-2 students.	The problem sets were very helpful in learning the material. Most students thought that the problem sets were difficult although some felt that the easy grading compensated for this. Common room hours were highly recommended by many students while others suggested attending office hours. Some students worked alone while others collaborated. Those who did collaborate often reported that it was vital and helped them get through the problem sets.	There were no labs.	6.011 has one main oddity in grading: at the beginning of the term you choose whether or not to hand in psets(3pnts each) to count as 10% of your final grade, or to not hand in psets and have grades lie on your exams. Almost all students reported that the grading was `very fair.'  They reported that the graders looked for understanding and were lenient about algebra mistakes.	Keep your 6.003 and 6.041 textbooks for this course. It has no textbook of it's own, but does have class notes that can be purchased at CopyTech. Many students said the class notes were extremely useful.  Students who liked the notes mentioned the problems at the end of the chapter as being particularly good, and that the notes were closely related to the class material. The largest complaints about the notes were that they were too dense and had an odd and confusing organization. Some suggested that more simple example problems in the text would help as well as bullet points emphasizing the material covered in each section.	Students generally agreed that the quizes were fair and reflected the material covered well although a minority found them excruciatingly difficult.  The material and difficulty resembled the problem sets.  Some complained that the True/False questions were ineffective and unfair. Students who commented on the final said it was much more difficult than other exams.

Students each had their own suggestions, there was no predominant theme:\n\n--limit problem sets assigned on quiz weeks\n--more applications of the material\n-- add more common examples (in both class and notes)\n--review 6.003 and 6.041 at the beginning of term\n--amazing teaching staff, try to do it again\n--improve class notes\n--makes final worth less	http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Electrical-Engineering-and-Computer-Science/6-011Spring2004-Spring2005/CourseHome/	t	f	CCS	12	0	\N	\N	\N

Also, this class was a good introduction to algorithms - useful for both theoretical and applied computer science. Students learned to solve complex problems more cleverly and efficiently.	Psets were useful in solidifying what was taught in class, but were fairly tricky and time-consuming.  Collaboration was common.  There were fewer than 3 problems in each pset, but they required proofs in length and therefore took some time. Many students responded that homework labs were extremely helpful. Some complained that the grading policy was unclear.	No labs.	Pset grading was done on a scale of check-minus, check, or check-plus, and limited feedback was given. Psets normally counted for little, but had more weight if problems were not attempted.  Quiz grading was tough, but fair.	Although it could be dense, the textbook (CLRS) was excellent and comprehensive. Notes from OpenCourseWare and past terms were helpful to those who knew about them.	Quiz1 was in-class quiz and time was very tight; many students ran out of time and the average was very low (around 45/75). Quiz2 was take-home exam with 5 problems that were challenging and extremely time-consuming. Some complained that there was significant room for cheating on quiz 2.	"Grading is generous but people with weak math backgrounds should beware, because a lot of math majors also take the class."\n"Dumb pset policy. Although psets worth very little, if you don't do them they exponentially drop your grade."\n"A history of masochism, self-loathing and insomnia [is a prerequisite]"	Lecture notes in the style of 6.042 would be helpful, as would solutions to the exercises.

Case studies of working systems in the current literature provide comparisons and contrasts.  Students should have taken 6.001 and 6.004 prior to 6.033. Lectures describe the main ideas and techniques. Recitations go a level deeper by discussing designs of systems in more detail and by comparing and contrasting case studies of successful and unsuccessful computer systems. Design projects teach students to design systems on their own. We asked students to perform the design project into two stages: an intermediate brief proposal and a full paper. This approach allowed students to receive intermediate feedback on their designs, which seem to be appreciated.  To make room for tutorials and proposals we removed most one-pagers, except a few. The one pagers have always received mixed reviews; students seem to appreciate that they are history.	The course covered a lot of basic information about computer systems, such as modularity, memory, operating systems, and network security. It used a large selection of case studies to give students examples of how and how not to do things in the real world. Students saw the class as a broad introduction to a lot of topics essential to a working career in computer science, but some were disappointed in the lack of depth. The course satisfies a CI-M requirement and has an emphasis on writing.	Professor Kaashoek.\nReading famous papers.\nDesign projects.	Writing requirements.\nProfessor Liskov's lectures.\nLengthy readings.\nDesign projects.	Most students took the class either because it is a requirement for 6-3 majors or because it fulfills a CI-M requirement. Many wanted to improve their general knowledge of computer systems or were interested in learning about computer systems and networks.	Instead of problem sets, this course had weekly hands-on assignments. Students found them useful because they gave them Unix experience. They were easy and did not generally require collaboration or too much time.	Students found the design projects valuable, enjoyable, and useful. They were reasonably timed open-ended assignments that gave students an appreciation for the complexities and engineering issues involved in real-world design. They built on and solidified the material learned in class.	Students found the grading policy fair, but disliked the writing program's policies, which they found arbitrary.	Students found the class notes useful and thorough, but also dense and difficult to read. The papers were interesting, informative, and enjoyable. 	Students found exams and quizzes difficult to predict, with questions that ranged from obvious to obscure. Often, they felt the exams tested material from readings and recitations more than lectures. Quiz 2 was much harder than Quiz 1, and both depended heavily on the course notes, which students recommended reading in detail in order to do well.	"Everything you ever wanted to know about computers, but didn't know to ask"	Students desire a more coherent class, with quizzes that better reflect the material in lecture. The lectures should be more specific and in-depth, many students felt they were too broad, and not very directly tied to the readings for the day.	http://web.mit.edu/6.033/www/home.html 	t	f	\N	12	4	\N	\N	\N

Some took it to get more background in the material as preparation for 6.003 and 6.004.  Students recommended the class for anyone interested in the subject material as it taught a lot of important concepts without imposing a heavy workload.	There were weekly problem sets which were considered relatively useful in formalizing the material learnt in lectures.  They were found to be relatively easy and struck a good balance between concepts and application.  Students did not collaborate and did not use bibles.	There were weekly labs assigned during three hour class sessions.  Students found that the labs were interesting and fun.  They were also of reasonable length and most students found that they could be completed within the alloted time slots.	Grades were assigned based on three quizzes (45%), problem sets and labs (25%), mini-quizzes (20%), and class participation (10%).  Some students thought grading was fair, while others were not sure what to think as they had not received their grade yet.	There was no textbook.  Class notes consisted of lecture notes provided by the staff.  They were found to be useful in doing the problem sets.	There were 15-30 minute weekly mini-quizzes that were helpful to review learning.\n\nIn addition, there were three open-book quizzes, including one during finals week.  Quizzes covered the material comprehensively and were considered fair.  Since the problems were similar to those on problem sets and labs, students recommended preparing for quizzes by reviewing problem sets and labs.

The course provides the necessary background on digital design techniques to enable students to conceive, design, and debug a reasonably complicated final project. The course starts with an introduction to the basics of digital logic and implementation using discrete components (gates, flip-flops, counters, etc.). The focus is however, on the implementation of digital logic using FPGAs. The course also covers interfacing to components at the system level – this includes memory cores, analog-to-digital and digital–to-analog converters. The problem sets are designed to help with the four labs and the lectures provide the necessary theory needed to complete the labs and the final project. Students gain confidence in their abilities to design and implement complex systems. They are ready to take on large, unstructured designs. The 6.111 lab kit is based on a state-of-the-art 6 million gate FPGA and includes support for video, audio and several digital interfaces.   Typical projects include the implementation of games, multimedia (video, audio, and graphics), robotics, and wireless.	The subject covered digital design from the ground up, building abstractions from transistor level, to the gate level, to system level.  It tacked timing constraints, and design sense, and was very applications-oriented.  Students found that most of their learning came from the lab work.	Teaching staff\nPowerful FPGA Labkit\nFun labs and final project	CI requirement\nXilinx development environment\nLong hours in lab	Most students took the class because it was an Institute Lab and CI-M.  Several took it because of the project, and recommended taking it with a friend.	The three small problem sets were easy for those with previous digital experience (6.004), but were nonetheless helpful in preparing for the labs.	Labs were long, particularly in debugging designs, but were rewarding and essential to learning.  Students wished that they could work from home more easily.	Grading was heavily weighted toward the final project (36%) and the labs (48%).  Students thought that grading was fair, reflecting both understanding and effort.	Most students didn't use any books, and found the lecture notes sufficient.	The one quiz was fair, covered relevant material, and was of appropriate difficulty.	"There's enough abstraction that you don't have to understand the specifics of EE (just some of it)."\n\n"I thought this class was excellent (both in content and teaching style) and it definitely made me change my attitude towards EE (in a positive way)."	Students wished there was an audio lab as in past terms.  Some also wished that the lecture notes had more textual detail.	http://web.mit.edu/6.111/	f	t	dept_lab	12	12	\N	\N	\N

Systems that employ embedded micro-control are all around you: CD and MP3 players, kitchen appliances like microwave ovens, cellular phones, calculators, television sets, and high performance aircraft, to name a few.  In ways you may not realize, even very familiar consumer products that existed in some form before the microprocessor benefit in their contemporary incarnations from microcontrollers.  A modern, high-end luxury automobile will typically contain more than a dozen microcontrollers to provide everything from engine and emissions control to music programming.  This class is your passport into the world of people who love to build elegant, efficient systems that work.\n\nCourse topics include optical tomography, multi-axis robot arm control, video and audio signal processing, power electronics including laptop power supplies and fluorescent lamp ballasts, and numeric computation (calculators and floating point calculations). This class is not particularly about learning how a specific microcontroller is programmed, or about designing circuits, or about wiring chips together.  We do a little of all of these things, but our real goal is to introduce you to a palette of tools and techniques that let you build what you can imagine.  These techniques are much more general than the details of a single processor or programming language.  Chips come and go, but successful approaches for engineering design have a life that spans many iterations of a particular technology.  \n\nStudents build a PIC microcontroller development system. You can keep this system and your course multimeter if you complete the class.\n	In 6.115, students were able to apply theoretical material learned in previous classes to build devices with microcontrollers.  The class teaches students how to build complex systems: programming microcontrollers, adding peripheral chips, and debugging.  A few students also commented that the class taught them how to handle adversity and tackle challenges.	Leeb\nLabs\nMicrocontrollers and the robot arm	Length of labs\nProblems with lab equipment\nOverall time commitment	Many students took 6.115 in order to fulfill their department or Institute Lab requirement.  Some students also took it because they enjoyed tinkering with microcontrollers and electronics and wanted to further their hobby.  Several students also commented that Professor Leeb's reputation as a great instructor encouraged them to take this class.	There were no problem sets for this class.	Labs, especially lab 4, took an exceptionally long time, and students disagreed on whether the time commitment was reasonable.  Students learned a lot from the labs and thought they were very rewarding.  Exercises were sometimes affected by flaky equipment.	The overall grade is based on 50% labs, 20% final project, 25% midterm, 5% attendance.  Grading was generally thought to be fair, although a few students would have preferred that the midterm be counted less.	The class notes from the lectures were available only during class.  Opinion was divided on whether these notes were useful.\n\nOf the other three textbooks, the 8051 manual was deemed essential, while the Yeralan book was widely criticized as useless.  Some students thought the Scherz  text was a good reference.	There was one open-book quiz and no final in this class.  The midterm quiz mainly tested concepts from the labs.  Most students agreed that although the quiz was difficult, it was fair.  However, a few students thought that the quiz was unnecessarily tricky.	"Warning: This class is not for the faint-at-heart 6-3 student."\n\n"Those allergic to circuits should leave now."	Many students thought that more staff lab hours would have been helpful.  Some students also thought that some labs could have been shorter.	http://web.mit.edu/6.115/www/	f	t	dept_lab	12	12	\N	\N	\N

This class taught building and maintaining moderate-to-large software systems using the Java programming language.  It covered topics such as object-oriented programming, software design, code documentation and specifications, unit testing, representation invariants and abstraction functions, design patterns, module dependencies, and working in a software team.  These topics were covered in lecture but most of the learning was done through problem sets.  The class was extremely practical, but required a huge time commitment, especially for students who were unfamiliar with Java before the class.

There were students outside of VI-3 who took the class because they wanted to learn more about programming and to learn software skills which would make them employable in industry, as well as obtain real world experience and make cool final projects.  Other (tongue-in-cheek) motivations cited included masochism and wanting to have no life.  Students recommended the class for anyone who wanted to be a better software engineer and programmer, but warned that it was very time-intensive and should be taken with an extremely light load.  Students also recommended taking the class with friends who would make good final project partners.	There were six weekly problem sets that took up the first half of the semester.  Problem sets were essential for learning the material, but students found them ridiculously long, especially the final one, which usually took over 30 hours to complete and tended to ruin many students' Spring Break.  Students complained that the psets were sometimes ambiguous and tested too many small details.  The collaboration policy was fairly draconian, so students generally sought help from LAs.  Students advised starting on problem sets early as they could take a long time.	There was a final project, which took up the second part of term.  Students worked in teams of up to four people on either Gizmoball (a pinball simulator) or Antichess (an AI game similar to chess except that the goal was to lose all your pieces).  The final project was long, difficult, and intense, but students found it pretty cool and felt a sense of satisfaction on completing a fairly interesting project.  It also provided a good application of all the concepts taught in the class.  Students recommended starting early on the final project as it would take a long time.  Finding a good team early to work with was also very strongly recommended.	Grades were assigned based on seven problem sets (41%), two quizzes (24%), a final project (30%), and TA discretion (5%).  Students generally found the grade breakdown fair, but they found grading on  quizzes unfair.  Students were divided on problem set grading; some felt that it was fair, while others felt that it was rigid, harsh, and arbitrary.  A few comments noted that this could be due to the standards of different TAs.	There was a required text &quot;Effective Java Programming Language Guide&quot; by Joshua Bloch.  Students generally felt that the text was not really necessary for the class, although some mentioned that it was useful in preparing for quizzes.	There were two quizzes during the semester.    They were hard, tested obscure minutiae of Java, had ambiguous questions, and tested concepts that were generally disjoint from those in psets and the final project.  Students felt that the questions were unnecessarily tricky and did not test general understanding.  In addition, many students were irritated that the quizzes were highly buggy and multiple corrections had to be issued during each quiz.	"I didn't learn most of the stuff that they wanted me to because I was too busy coding."\n\n"Things 6.170 stole from me: My life. My sanity. My girlfriend."\n\n"If your teammates suck, you lose. really. hard. And there's nothing you can do about it."\n\n"Exams were pointless."\n\n"Even though it's [the final project] a ton of time, it's much more fun working in a group and on something cool. Its very satisfying to see it all work."	Several suggestions were given by a large number of students:  (1) Eliminate quizzes.  (2) Reduce the workload.  (3) Be more flexible with deadlines and allow extensions instead of merely slack days.  (4) Help struggling students out, instead of trying to make them drop the class, and to quote one comment (among several others), &quot;It seemed like the staff was more interested in kicking out the weaker students than helping them learn.&quot;	http://www.mit.edu/~6.170/	f	f	dept_lab	15	12	\N	\N	\N

This class teaches Minsky's theories of AI.  The content was interesting and stimulating.  There is no set curriculum  so people had a lot of freedom to explore.   One downside is that there is little real application and the ideas were more useful psychologically than computationally.  	Marvin Minsky\nFinal Project\nImpromptu discussion	Lack of structure and feedback\nPsets that don't get you thinking critically about the theory	Students took this class because they wanted to learn more about AI from the famous Professor Minsky.	Collaboration on the problem sets were not necessary and most students did not collaborate or use a bible.  Opinions are divided about whether the psets tested the reading or should be replaced by one-page responses.	This class had no labs.  The final project was considered the best part of the class: fun, open-ended, and reasonable in length.	Grading for this class was considered fair  to lax and not too quantitative.  At the time of the survey the final paper, which was a significant part of the grade, had not yet been returned.	Minsky's book &quot;The Emotion Machine&quot; was the textbook for this class. Students liked the reading because it got them to think about how they think.  The textbook was also useful for doing problem sets. 	This class did not have any exams	"What can I say? Minsky is a legend, and great at leading discussions. The opportunity to pick his brain is more than enough reason to take the class."\n\n"Marvin Minsky is pure genius. It was truly a pleasure to come to class each week to listen to him speak."\n	There were suggestions for more structure (e.g. lesson plans for each lecture).

Overall, students felt they were interesting and hefty, but key to gaining a strong understanding the material. A little more skeleton code would've helped save gruntwork. Some students found collaboration to be very helpful.	The final project was open for students to explore topics they were personally interested in and apply techniques learned in the class. It helped students better understand the specific topic from the class that related to their project. Students felt the project was fun and fulfilling.	The grading seemed to be fair, but problem set solutions were not posted and points were sometimes deducted without a clear explanation. Students were unclear what it took to get an A or B, so they felt the grading was ambiguous.	The class notes were very helpful when published. However, the latter half of the course did not have class notes and students found this very frustrating. There was no official textbook, but some of the recommended books were helpful.	None.	"Inspiring! Makes me even more excited about robotics research."\n"Lot of funny robot movies."\n"What happened to the lecture notes during the second half of the course??"	The class could be improved by paring down some of the side topics discussed and introducing machine learning sooner. Some students would have preferred more examples, as well as directed reading and discussion of seminal research papers. Students would have preferred more lectures like the final learning lecture and fewer proofs to introduce and teach topics. They felt they got lost in the details and notation of the proof instead of first understanding the algorithm being presented.		f	f	AIA	12	0	\N	\N	\N

Sussman\nHanson\nBlair (Ziggy)\nScheme	Time-Consuming\nToo much concern with implementation details	Most students took it because it satisfied the AI requirement for the MEng.  Others took it because they enjoyed coding in Scheme and either liked programming or wanted to become a better programmer.	There were eight problem sets.  Students found that the problem sets were useful and helpful in learning the material.  Allowing for creativity, they were generally thought of as fun.  The main gripes was the time involved and their occasionally excessive focus on implementation details.	There was an extremely open-ended final project, where students had a large amount of freedom to decide on the scope and breadth of their project.  Some students found that this made the project unguided and unfocused.	Grades for the class were determined by a combination of eight problem sets, a final project, and class participation.\n\nThe class felt that grading was extremely fair, although it could be slow.	There was no textbook.  Students referred mainly to SICP - the book &quot;Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs&quot; by Gerald Sussman and Hal Abelson (also used in 6.001 and available online.)  Most students found that a combination of SICP and lecture notes were sufficient, although some students mentioned that a textbook would have been useful.	There were no quizzes.	[On Sussman] "One of the best professors I've ever had. Energetic, enthusiastic, intelligent, clear."\n\n"...never before had I had a recitation instructor who went over my every line of code, test-cases, in such excruciating detail."	Students would have liked to have more guidance on the final project, such as feedback on project ideas and/or examples of past final projects.

We cover deterministic and stochastic signal processing, image processing, and statistical inference.\n\nThis elective is of interest to students who want opportunities for hands-on application of signal processing techniques and experience with real-world biomedical problems.  Students should take this course to prepare for work in an academic or commercial environment where they will need to analyze biomedical signals and/or medical images.\n\nOur goal is to give students a toolbox and the knowledge of when to use each tool so that they have skills to approach new problems/applications with signal procssing techniques appropriate to their current problem/application. \n\nLectures provide theoretical material and background on physiological and medical systems, as well as real-world examples from guest lecturers working in the field. \n\nLabs are done with partners but written up independently. Partners may share figures, Matlab code, and ideas but not the text of lab reports. Group work is okay for homework problem sets.\n\n6.003 or equivalent is required as a prerequiste. Familiarity with  probability and statistics is helpful. The class can be taken before or after 6.011/6.341 as it gives practical aspects of some theoretical topics covered in those courses. 	6.555J/16.456J/HST.582J covered the theory and practice of applying signal processing to medical purposes.  This included, among other things, speech and image processing and detection theory.  Students felt that there was a good balance between theory and application in the class.  Learning was reinforced by labs, which were found to be interesting, enjoyable, and relevant.	Lectures\nLabs\nInteresting material	Lecture Slides and Course Notes not sufficiently detailed\nLong lab reports\nLecturers rush through too much material	Students took the class because they were interested in applications of signal processing.  They recommended the class to those who knew some signal processing theory and were interested in learning more about applications.  They also highlighted the importance of getting hands-on experiences through the labs.	There were five problem sets.  Problem sets were found to be generally okay and useful in learning the material.  Most students did not collaborate nor use a bible.	In addition to the problem sets, there were five labs using MATLAB.  Labs were considered extremely helpful to learn the material and were usually interesting, although sometimes they could be tedious.  Some students said the labs were the best part of the class and really made the class worthwhile.	Grades for this class were assigned based on five labs (60%), two quizzes (25%), five problem sets (10%), and class participation (5%).\n\nStudents found the grading policies fair.\n	There was no textbook.  Readings for the class consisted of a mixture of lecture slides, handouts and class notes.  Responses of students to class notes were mixed.  Some students found the class notes useful and comprehensive, while others found the notes dense and hard to follow.	There were two quizzes and no final.  They were found to be fair, but generally a bit difficult.  They covered the concepts and topics in lectures, but at a deeper conceptual level, without getting into grungy mathematics.  Annotated outlines were provided before quizzes, which students found to be useful.	"Mike is the most awesome TA ever!"

The course covers both continuous- and discrete-time systems in both the time and transform domains.  Topics include convolution representation of LTI systems, Fourier series, Fourier transforms, applications to filtering, sampling, and communications, Laplace and z-transforms, and a brief introduction to feedback systems.\n\n    This is a required core subject in EECS.  The subject material is central not only to professionals in EECS but in fact to ALL engineering disciplines (and are of importance in the pure and social sciences as well).  The subject material serves as the foundation for a remarkably broad array of areas of inquiry and consequently forms a very important part of a professional education in EECS.\n\n    All undergrads in EECS should take this subject, and I would argue that almost every student at MIT should be exposed to at least some of this material either in 6.003 or in courses in their own departments.\n    The most important prerequisites for this subject are facility in manipulating and understanding complex numbers and some background in differential equations or systems of some kind.  For EECS majors, 6.002  satisfies the latter (and to some extent the former), although a course in other types of systems (e.g., dynamic systems as studied in ME courses) would be of comparable value.\n\n    Signals and systems is a subject that involves building remarkably useful and varied constructs for applications ranging from signal and image processing to communications and feedback system design.  Because of this breadth of applicability, what is most important is that students develop an understanding BOTH of the basic ideas AND of how we use those ideas as building blocks in putting together more complex concepts.  For these reasons, I believe that it is essential that we teach the fundamentals  thoroughly and then help the students to see how to use them and to \nappreciate the power of these tools.\n    I would say that the most important thing that I would like students to understand coming out of this course is how to think WITH PRECISION about signals and systems.  In particular, this involves being able to separate out what are the fundamental concepts from what are the details or  conclusions built from those fundamentals.  I personally believe that this is the most important thing that we can do in order to help students avoid falling into the trap of trying to memorize everything we teach.  In particular, my contention is that there are far fewer fundamental concepts in 6.003 than might be apparent when you look at all the material we cover. The key is that we in essence build “Macros” by combining a small number of basic ideas to form more complex and often profound conclusions, and once the student understands this, he or she is in excellent position to organize his or her understanding of the material in a way that is simultaneously much simpler AND much deeper.\n    It is THAT understanding that I hope students come away having mastered from their entire MIT education.  I view our effort in 6.003 as an attempt to introduce and help foster that type of disciplined thinking.\n    As for specific concepts to understand, I would say that there are two basic things I would like students to APPRECIATE.  The first is the meaning of linearity and time-invariance and the implications that these properties have in terms of the depth of analysis and insight we can perform for LTI systems.  The second is the general idea of\nmoving seamlessly between the time and transform (Fourier, Laplace, or Z) domains and the complementary insights and tools that come from these different ways in which we can view signals and systems.\n\n    I believe that working together to try to understand material, wrestling with tough concepts and problems, and asking questions of each other, etc., are very important in mastering any subject and, most definitely, 6.003. We DO, therefore, encourage students to interact with each other but we do ask that the work they hand in be their own.  Since the organization of the material and the choice of text has changed only recently, the issue of using bibles is comparatively minor.  Generally, however, I do NOT recommend the use of bibles to get solutions to problems for problem sets.  For the more general issue of mastering the material, we do try to provide the students with sufficient material to accomplish this; however, for some students, having additional problems to solve and solutions to examine can be of some value.  Consequently, I don’t have an absolute stance on bibles.\n\n    Within a few years, this course will adapt to the expected changes in the EECS undergraduate curriculum.  Students entering 6.003 will have been exposed to some of the ideas, albeit in less rigorous and focused manner, and we will want to leverage that experience not by including more material but in helping the students gain a deeper appreciation of the subject material.  	The class is a basic introduction to signal processing in LTI systems in both temporal and frequency spaces, and develops part of the essential background knowledge needed for more advanced topics in signal processing.  Students learnt about converting signals from time space to frequency space and vice versa using transforms such as Fourier, Laplace and Z transforms.  In addition, system techniques such as modulation and feedback were also studied and analyzed using (primarily) frequency analysis.  The subject was largely mathematical and theoretical, although some applications were presented.  Although the class was mathematical, students generally felt that it was engineering math that had many applications in practice.  Students generally liked the content and felt that they learnt a lot about signal processing and LTI systems.	Lectures\nCool Demos\nTutorial notes\nWell-taught recitations\nInteresting material	Long problem sets\nMATLAB\nFast pace of class\nExams	Most students took the class because it was a requirement for Course VI.  Some students felt that they did it because it was required, but the class stimulated an interest in signal processing.  Students recommended the class to anyone who was interested in signal and systems-related topics such as feedback systems or audio/video processing, but warned that anyone considering taking the class should be interested in math or be willing to do a ton of math.  Several Course VI-3 students commented that they didn't see how the material would be relevant to their work and wished that they did not have to take it; in the new VI-3 curriculum, 6.003 is no longer mandatory.	There were weekly problem sets.  Students found that the questions could be challenging and the problem sets could be long, but they were useful for learning the material and extremely helpful in preparing for examinations.  Students found that collaboration on the harder problems in the problem set was extremely useful.	There were three labs, which were long assignments in MATLAB.  Students had varied opinions on the usefulness of the labs.  Some students felt that the labs were reasonable in length, fun, enjoyable and helped put the material learnt in class in perspective, while others felt that the labs were long and tedious and did not contribute much to learning.  Many students enjoyed lab 2, which synthesized telephone touch tones.  Students' major complaint was that the lab materials did not provide much help with learning MATLAB and thus many students wasted a lot of time learning MATLAB in order to do the labs.	Students were assigned grades based on two quizzes (40%), a final examination (40%), and problem sets, labs, and instructor feedback (20%).  Students felt that the grading policy was generally fair, although some students felt that the emphasis on quizzes and examinations was too high.  Many students commented about the problem set grading policy, which gave grades on a scale of 0-3.  Students generally liked this coarse scale as it reduced the stress of problem sets, although some students felt that this made it difficult to differentiate the abilities of students.	The required textbook was the second edition of &quot;Signals and Systems&quot; by Oppenheim, Willsky and Nawab.  In addition, the second edition of &quot;Computer Explorations in Signals and Systems\nUsing MATLAB&quot; by Buck, Daniel and Singer was required for the MATLAB labs.  Students found the textbook helpful for learning the subject, although it was long and verbose.  Lecture slides were also given out and were found to be useful as a summary of lectures and the material.  Tutorial and Recitation notes were also provided (depending on your recitation/tutorial instructors) and several students loved them, especially the notes by Joseph Cheng and Scott Paige.	There were two quizzes and a final examination.  Quizzes were generally easier than problem sets and were found to be difficult, but fair.  They tested a wide range of material and emphasized understanding and intuition over mathematical details.  Students generally found the quizzes to be a good test of understanding and comprehension.  To prepare for quizzes, students suggested looking through problem sets, as well as quizzes from previous semesters.	"I have told everyone I know to take 6.003, because it is applicable in all fields of engineering and is an awesome class."\n\n"The tutorial notes were awesome, definitely continue or improve that."\n\n"MATLAB is annoying."	Students suggested making lecture notes more verbose and thorough, similar to tutorial notes, which students really enjoyed.	http://web.mit.edu/6.003/www/	f	f	core	15	4	\N	\N	\N

The competition rewards clever strategies and efficiency.  The competition culminates in the Final Tournament in Kresge Auditorium where the top 8 teams battle it out on screen.  6.370 also has a classy Finalists' Celebration for the top teams.  Like all 6.370 events, this event has free food.  Prizes totaled almost $40,000.\n\nTo help with the competition, we have provided 10 lectures, almost twice as many as the previous year.  Lectures cover topics such as Navigation, Strategy, Decision Trees and Swarm AI.  Students are also encouraged to scrimmage online against other students to gain strategic insights and improve their players.\n\nThis course is attractive because of its game-like nature, opportunities to outwit opponents, interesting material, free food and great prizes.  This class is especially relevant for course 6 and 14 students.  In addition, student get to network with industry leaders in the field.\n\nStudents should have a basic grasp of some programming language, ideally JAVA, before taking this course.  One of our main goals for next year will be making it easier to enjoy the course if you are unfamiliar with it and even unfamiliar to programming.  We hope that contestants at all levels will be able to get the most out of 6.370 next year.	In 6.370, students learned how to program AI strategies and how to work in a team.

Students are often surprised by the extent to which we draw on the prerequisite material from 6.003 and 6.041 --- so make sure you review material from those courses before starting on 6.011. \n\nWe introduce students to ways of describing noisy or uncertain signals in both the time- and frequency-domains (covariance/correlation functions and power spectral densities respectively), and use these representations to pose and solve problems of inference (estimation/prediction and detection/hypothesis testing). The course also develops state-space representations for causal systems (where a key inference problem centers on reconstructing the state from input and output measurements).	The subject was a header for Communication, Control and Signal Processing concentration. It therefore gave an overview into various topics in the field like frequency characteristics of stochastic signals, filtering of stochastic signals, state space models, and inferences. In addition to intensive mathematical analysis, the course also presented some application of the theoretical concepts. This combination was viewed by many students as giving the course good balance between theory and application.	Verghese\nLaura Zager\nOpen office hours\nMaterial	Lectures\nChallenging problem sets	Most students took this course as an EE header requirement. Others took it as a prerequisite for more advanced courses. Many also expressed their enjoyment of the courses' prerequisites, 6.003 and 6.041, as one of their reasons for taking this course.	Problem sets were considered by many as an essential part of their learning and understanding the course material as it gave interesting insights over extensive topics in the material. Students thought the problem sets were reasonable but could be tedious.	None.	Problem sets were graded roughly from a scale of 0 to 3 to show the progress of work done in the homework. The overall grading in the class, both quizzes and problem sets, was considered fair.	The class notes were considered very helpful, but many students suggested that they could be improved by having more extensive explanations and examples. Some students used them mainly to do homework problems.	The quizzes covered the course material extensively with questions in the exams of similar difficulty to those on the problem sets. Many students regarded quiz 1 as lengthy and hard while quiz 2 was considered fair. Sufficient understanding of material from prerequisites like 6.003, in addition to 6.011 material, was essential to doing well in quizzes.

The\nintellectual thread of the course revolves around a framework for\ncontrolling complexity in engineering design: primitive elements, means of\ncombination, means of abstraction, and common patterns of use.  We apply\nthis framework to software, control systems, circuits, and Markov models.\n\nBesides introducing fundamental EE and CS material.  we also hope to create\na more active learning environment than in typical lecture-recitation\nclasses.  Students spend the bulk of weekly schedule in labs writing\nprograms, building circuits, and working with mobile robots.  This year we\nalso experimented with making heavy use of student lab assistants,\nincluding inviting students currently taking the subject to serve as guest LAs in order to create a seamless environment between teaching and\nlearning.\n\nThis was the first semester that 6.01 was taught at full scale.  We'll be\ndebugging it over coming semesters in response to student feedback.\n	Students generally reported that 6.01 was a broad introduction to EE and CS, with some commenting that it focused slightly more on the CS side of things. Topics included programming in Python and general programming concepts, like modeling and abstraction, circuit theory, state machines, and linear feedback systems using op-amps. Many complained that the course was overly broad without being deep, and the course content was presented in an oversimplified manner. Some said that they were not sure what they had learned in the class, and they weren't sure that they had learned the concepts generally enough to apply elsewhere.\n\nThe dominant feature of the course was the lab component, which focused on applying the course ideas to a robot. Students had varied reactions to this. A number of students reported that the labs were useful for learning and helped teach them the course concepts. However, others found that the labs involved too much pre-written code and hand-holding, which limited the amount of problem-solving that was required. They also found that the lectures were driven by the labs, making the course very application-intensive rather than theoretical.	Labs that allowed students to apply the material\nHelpful TAs and LAs\nMaking the robot obey you	Faulty lab equipment\nLong lab writeups\nBusywork\nPoorly organized lectures	Most students took 6.01 to get a feel for Course 6 as a major or because they had already decided on Course 6 and it was a requirement. Some students did not recommend the class for people who were not serious about Course 6, and some reported that it discouraged them from being Course 6 altogether, but others found it to be a good introduction to programming and said that students in every major would get something out of taking it. Many cautioned that people taking the class should be prepared to devote lots of time to it and ask for help from the TAs if necessary.	Students found the online tutor problems to be relatively easy and very useful for learning Python. However, the problem sets, which consisted of lab writeups, were long, tedious, and difficult. Generally, they required overly-detailed analysis of what the students had already done in the labs, which did not teach anything above and beyond what the lab already taught. Many students reported that collaboration was essential, but others were able to get by without it.	The lab component for 6.01 consisted of a 1.5-hour software (programming) lab and a 3-hour design lab each week. Most students praised the software labs for being useful and reasonable in length. Students had mixed views on the design labs. Some reported that the design labs helped them learn the material, and that they were interesting and fun. However, others complained about faulty lab equipment and poor lab organization, which made the labs take longer than they should have and made them less enjoyable. Students also said that some of the labs were guided to the point that design wasn't really necessary, since one only had to follow the directions to complete the lab.	Students had mixed opinions on whether or not grading was fair. There were ample opportunities to get extra credit with exploration labs, though many students were not aware of this or were confused about it. Others griped about losing lots of points for little things on their lab writeups. Several students complained that the lab writeups being worth 40% of the grade was unreasonable due to the amount of collaboration and the fact that they didn't really evaluate understanding of the material. Students also complained about the nanoquizzes being worth too much, and the midterm and final being worth too little.	There was no textbook for 6.01, but students found the class notes to be very useful and thorough, even more so than the lectures themselves.	There were weekly nanoquizzes in addition to a take-home midterm and a take-home final. Most students found the nanoquizzes to be fairly easy if one kept up on the weekly tutor problems and lab assignments. However, they were also disproportionately weighted relative to their length, and many students did not realize how much the nanoquizzes counted for until near the end of the class. Some students also said that it was easy to lose lots of points quickly for careless mistakes because the quizzes were so short.\n\nThe three-hour midterm was long and difficult, much more difficult than the practice test indicated, though in the end it was curved generously. Many students were not looking forward to the six-hour final exam.	"Ability to do anal retentive work is a must."\n\n"I am so sick of these robots."\n\n"[On printed course notes]: Just because you're not Al Gore doesn't mean you don't have to care about the trees."	Students had a variety of suggestion for how to improve the course. Several called for better documentation in the provided code, to make it clearer what the code was doing and to provide an example of what good code looks like. Some said that vastly different levels of experience with programming made the class inherently difficult to teach, since some students were bored and others found it extremely difficult, and one student suggested breaking the class into multiple sections as in 8.01/8.012. Finally, a handful of students suggested that more enthusiastic lecturing would help, and that not trying to unify all of the topics might make it easier to do each one justice.	http://mit.edu/6.01/index.html 	f	t	core	12	6	\N	\N	A few students complained about the class's disorganization or said that they weren't sure what they had learned, but most thought that the class had outlined and achieved its objectives well.

This course is for students who really want to understand Maxwell's equations and their effect on media.  Particular attention is directed to electric field effects and magnetic field effects on dielectric and magnetic fluids-electrohydrodynamics and ferrohydrodynamics.   Students should have a good understanding of electric and magnetic field solving of problems as a problem solving approach is used to illustrate and explore fundamental concepts.	The class covers fluid and EQS/MQS field interactions and stability. Students learn about topics such as transfer relations for electric fields, magnetic fields, and pressure-velocity relationships for planar layers, cylindrical layers, and spherical layers.	Professor Zahn	None	Students took this course because it would help their research. Future students are advised to make sure they have taken a course on basic EM field theory.	Problem sets were very useful and good for preparing for exams. Some of the solutions were available online, and students were allowed to cite them.	N/A	Grading was fair and mostly dependent on exams.	The Melcher textbook was not very useful. Students mostly relied on the class notes, which were very helpful.	The open-note, open-book exams were very similar to the problem sets, but they were rather long. 	"It seems like we did a bunch of perturbations of the same problem for the last 2 months of the term."	Instead of doing a planar, cylindrical, and spherical problem for each topic, maybe do a planar problem for one topic, then move on to the next topic, and do a cylindrical problem for that topic, etc. I think a lot more could be covered this way, especially since the problems take a long time.		f	f	EEE	12	0	\N	\N	Prof Zahn covered everything as he had indicated in the beginning of the term.

The subjects include diffusion, osmosis, carrier mediated transport, ion transport, and electrical response of cells (Hodgkin-Huxley model). \n\nThis is a header subject for course 6 students, because this covers the most basic concepts relevant to cellular physiology. It is one of the restricted elective subject for course 20 students, and this course will complement their core curriculum. This course will build the fundamentals for any biomedical research, and is especially useful for students who are interested in neuroscience / engineering. \n\nThis course is intended for juniors and seniors in engineering school, who have previously taken at least one engineering subject at the sophomore level. It involves various engineering mathematical concepts, so some familiarity with those would help students a lot. \n\nThe teach staffs' goals are 1) Teach / reinforce the most fundamental transport concepts 2) Teach / reinforce the scientific communication skills 3) Introduce the fundamentals of neuroscience to the students. Personally, I think the concept of Hodgkin-Huxley model would be very interesting and useful for students to remember for their future career. \n\nCollaboration to solve homework problems is encouraged, but students should take note of any collaboration in their work. Some of the projects require students to collaborate, and all students in a team will get the same grade in the end. Bibles do exist and some students use them, but relying on bibles entirely is not recommended since it robs the chance for students to struggle with the new concepts and learn properly. Historically, students who did their homework on their own had performed better on the exams. \n\nThe course content will be mostly stable for a few years to come, but we may introduce some new examples (especially in the area of neuroscience / engineering) in the future. 	Students learned about electrical properties of cells, including cell transport, diffusion, and the Hodgkin–Huxley model.

The problem sets were very useful for learning the material and of average difficulty by MIT standards.	Students were irritated by the labs' lengths and tedium and a few further felt that they were too open-ended. However, they found the material to be generally interesting.	The grading was fair. 	The textbook was extremely useful and valuable. 	The first exam was much more difficult than the second, but both exams were fair.	"Labs are fun and helps to understand subjects. First one is a little bit tedious to analyze." \n\n"The microfluid lab gives you valuable experience in bio-lab that normal Course 6 people don't usually get."

How to design good user interfaces, starting with human capabilities (including the human information processor model, perception, motor skills, color, and attention) and using those capabilities to drive design techniques: task analysis, user-centered design, iterative design, usability guidelines, and graphic design principles.\n\n* Implementation.  Techniques for building user interfaces, including low-fidelity prototypes, Wizard of Oz, and other prototyping tools; input models, output models, model-view-controller, layout, constraints, declarative user interfaces, and toolkits.\n\n* Evaluation. Techniques for evaluating and measuring interface usability, including heuristic evaluation, predictive evaluation, and user testing.\n\nNecessary prerequisites are knowledge of Java and prior exposure to some graphical user interface programming.  6.170 provides both of these prerequisites, but students can get them other ways.  6.831 is not merely a design class; we actually build software, so programming skills are required.\n\nThe most important take-home concept from 6.831 is the importance of iterative design.  If the basic message of a course like 6.170 or 6.005 might be described as &amp;amp;amp;amp;quot;think first, code second&amp;amp;amp;amp;quot;, then 6.831 refines that message to &amp;amp;amp;amp;quot;think, code, evaluate, and then think again.&amp;amp;amp;amp;quot;  Another important message of 6.831 is that you are not the user -- if you design only for yourself, and what you think is appropriate, you won't produce usable software.\n\nCollaboration is encouraged -- students may discuss the assignments with each other, but all written and programming work on individual problem sets must be done by individuals.  Using bibles of past problem set solutions is not allowed.\n\n	6.831 taught students about human-computer interaction and how to design good user interfaces. The class struck a good balance between theory and application.

Some also needed to fulfill requirements. Advice to future students included having a project idea or project team in mind and being prepared to spend a lot of time.	Many students felt that the problem sets were useful, while some thought they were tedious and seemed like busywork. Students generally did not collaborate or use a bible.	The final group project was a lot of work and very time-consuming, but students felt it was rewarding and fun. Because the project was self-guided, it could be as difficult and ambitious as the students made it.	The grades were 40% project, 30% problem sets, 20% quizzes, and 10% participation. Students thought that grading was fair, though some complained that grading seemed subjective or arbitrary.	There were good class notes comprised of lecture slides. Students had to read the notes before each class and submit a reading memo. Some students felt the notes made lecture redundant.	Many students disliked the exams; complaints ranged from the exam requiring too much memorization to the grading being too subjective. Some students thought the quizzes helped draw out their understanding of the material. Students found that looking at past exams was helpful.	"This stuff is AMAZING.

Future students are advised to attend recitation and begin problem sets early.	Problem sets were long, but very useful in learning the material. Many students collaborated or sought help from TAs.	There were no labs.	Most students thought the grading policy was fair. It included curving exams up if the median was below 75, points for attending recitation (lowest two are dropped), dropping 10% of the weight off the lowest scoring exam, and dropping the lowest scoring problem set. It also gave cutoff values for specific letter grades.	There was a textbook on proofs, but it only applied to the first few weeks and many students did not use it.

The first half is devoted to various cellular transport mechanisms, including diffusion, osmosis, carrier mediated transport, and ion transport across cell membranes. The second half is devoted to the basics of signal transduction in neurons, including Hodgkin-Huxley model and action potential, myelinated and unmyelinated fiber, and biophysics of ion channels.\n\nThis course is a course 6 header for bioelectrical engineering concentration.  Students need to take this course to learn the basics of cellular physiology, in order to prepare further studies in this area. As an elective this course will provide quantitative insights on basic cellular physiology, as well as an introduction to the fundamentals of neuroscience.  \n\nStudents who are interested in biomedical / biological engineering / neuroscience as their future career path should take this course. We focus/stress more on quantitative understanding of biological systems, therefore requiring certain mathematical/engineering backgrounds at the level of 18.03 or 6.002. This course is great for students who thrive in projects / experiments, which is a significant part of the course. \n\nWe spend a lot of time in the projects, where students have a chance to apply what they learn in the lectures in solving the problem they chose. This is a great way to learn the two important themes. 1) Biological systems (cells) can be understood in quantitative terms. 2) Biological systems are complicated because of multiple driving forces / factors involved. \n\nWhile students are expected to submit their own work as homeworks and exams, projects are done in pairs collaborating toward the common goal. Students in a group will receive the same overall project grades. In doing so, students will learn how to collaborate with a partner, which is an important skill but not often taught or emphasized. Use of bibles (if there is any) is discouraged since students will lose the chance to test their own understanding before the exams, which usually contains new problems.\n\nThe main improvements of future 6.021 offerings would be 1) improving the projects 2) revising the course contents in order to reflect all the new development in the field.   \n	6.021 teaches students about quantitative cellular physiology. It covers such topics as the processes of diffusion, osmosis, the propagation of action potentials, osmotic equilibrium, electrodiffusion models, and active transport models. While parts of the course do cover electrical engineering approaches and concepts, 6.021 is still very focused on biology.	Professor Voldman\nHelpful TAs\nProjects	Lecture notes\nLab reports	Students took this course because they needed a Course 6 header or because they were interested in bioelectrical engineering. Future students are advised to choose a good lab partner and keep up with the material.	The problem sets were very useful for learning the material and preparing for exams. Some students collaborated, and many students also attended office hours.	There were two labs: a Microfluidics lab and a Hodgin-Huxley lab. Labs were done in pairs, and some students had difficulty working with their partners. Students had diverging opinions on which lab was better or useful. Labs were somewhat time consuming and also required lab write-ups and presentations.	Grading was done on a curve, centered around B. The late policy was strict; turning in an assignment even a minute late warranted a heavy penalty. Some students thought they were graded too harshly, while others thought the grading was fair.	The textbook was useful, but it was also very dense and verbose, and some students didn't use it. Class notes were briefer and more digestible, but not as complete.	There were two exams. The first one was straightforward and reasonable, and the second one was very difficult. The exams were generally fair.	"I was wary of taking this course because a friend of mine had not liked it, but I enjoyed the material. So the lesson is, your friends aren't necessarily right."\n\n"[Professor Voldman's] style was different from Professor Han's style, but it worked well sort of like how Captain and Tennille worked out. And each lecture, therefore, was like the song "Love will keep us together." Except it would be more like "Quantitative cell physiology keeps us together"...which it does if you think about it."	Students had various suggestions, such as relaxing the late policy and providing better class notes.		t	f	BEC	12	4	\N	\N	Objectives were clear and met.

It is a chance to remember why you came to MIT:  to learn and to build cool systems.  We study the design and construction of power electronic circuits and motor drives.  Laboratory exercises include the construction of drive circuit for an electric go-cart, flash strobes, computing power supplies, three-phase inverters for AC motors, and resonant drives for lamp ballasts and induction heating.  We examine basic electric machines including DC, induction, and permanent magnet motors. As a member of this class, you'll complete a sequence of assigned projects, followed by a final project of your choice, emphasizing creativity and uniqueness.\n\nThe overarching goal of this class is to share with you the skills and techniques that designers use to make useful systems that solve problems for people.  These are the skills that will make you successful in an engineering career.  They empower you to see the value of analysis techniques you have learned.   Your experience in this class will teach you to use analytical methods to constrain problems in ways that lead to winning solutions – answers that makes your UROP project successful, that make your thesis work, that make your product a commercial success, that let you stand flat-footed in front of a problem and fight to win.\n\nPower electronic circuits are the backbone of almost every modern convenience.  Automobiles, cell-phones, laptop and desktop computers, television sets, and kitchen appliances, among many other systems, require power electronics circuits to convert electrical energy to a useful form.  \n\nThe creation of a successful power electronic circuit almost always requires more than the application of a set of analytical techniques. The most elegant examples are crafted by engineers who have a rich understanding of how to make trade-offs amongst all the parts of a system, e.g,, thermal, mechanical, electrical, and sometimes software.  For this reason, we make special efforts to expose you to a huge number of demonstrations developed from a wide range of engineering disciplines, and to provide exciting laboratory experiences that let you try the techniques you learn on practical hardware.  \n\n	6.131 teaches students about energy conversions (AC-DC, etc.) and electrical devices such as motors and fluorescent lights. Students learn how to build circuits that utilize power efficiently. There is a tremendous amount of application, since students' grades come almost entirely from what they build.

This course is recommended to anyone working in integrated circuit design.	The problem sets were long and difficult, but they were very useful for learning the material. They gave students hands-on experience using CAD tools and analysis techniques presented in class.	There was a substantial open-ended design project that was a good opportunity to incorporate the design techniques students had learned throughout the course. The design project was somewhat lengthy and also conflicted with the second midterm, but students appreciated gaining additional design experience. The lab facilities were good and accessible.

Much of the material overlaps with 6.003 and 6.004, and as a survey course, 6.02 does not delve deeply into each topic. Students apply what they have learned in labs.	Labs\nMaterial	Lack of good reference material	Students took this course because it is required for course 6 majors. This course is not recommended for people who do not need to take it, because there are other courses that cover the same material but in greater depth and detail. Future students are advised to go to lecture, study hard for exams, and go to office hours.	The problem sets were not difficult, except for the problems on networks. They were useful for learning the material. Some students collaborated and attended office hours. Students felt that the easiness of the problem sets left them unprepared for the difficulty of the quizzes.	Labs were not time-consuming, usually taking less than three hours to complete. Students had varying opinions on how interesting and useful the labs were. Debugging was difficult, and sometimes even the TAs and LAs could not locate the problem. Lab equipment was reliable, except for a program called SUE, which kept crashing.	Students were mostly confused about how the grading policy worked. They knew, for example, what percentage of their grades was dependent on labs or quizzes, but they wanted to know how that translated into letter grades.	There were no textbooks or notes, only copies of the lecture slides. Most students found them very inadequate.	There were three exams, no final, and weekly miniquizzes. The exams were long and much harder than the problem sets, which caught students off-guard. The first exam was especially hard, forcing students to use concepts in ways they weren't used to. The second exam was better. The miniquizzes were held at the end of lecture, confusing some students who were trying to digest the new material while retaining enough of the old material to take the miniquiz.	"Textbook?

The course covers most of the topics in 6.431 (sample space, random variables, expectations, transforms, Bernoulli and Poisson processes, finite Markov chains, limit  theorems) but at a faster pace and in more depth. \n\nThere are also a number of additional topics such as: language, terminology, and key results from measure theory; interchange of limits and expectations; multivariate Gaussian distributions; deeper understanding of conditional distributions and expectations. \n\nThe course is geared toward students who need to use probability in their research at a reasonably sophisticiated level (e.g., to be able to read the research literature in communications, stochastic control, machine learning, queueing, etc., and to carry out research involving precise mathematical statements and proofs). \n\nOne of the functions of the course is to develop mathematical maturity. The course aims at developing in parallel probabilistic intuition and formal analysis of probabilistic models. A key objective is to develop the skill to translate intuitive informal probabilistic statements and arguments into precise ones. \n\nWhile the only formal prerequisite is 18.02, the course assumes some familiarity with elementary undergraduate probability and  mathematical maturity. A course in analysis would be helpful but is not required. Some familiarity with linear algebra is also useful. 	6.436 gives an advanced and rigorous overview of probability, covering such topics as measure theory, the theory of integration, sigma-fields, proof techniques, different notions of convergence of random variables, basic stochastic processes, in addition to the typical probability material developed in a more-or-less rigorous way. Other topics include Poisson processes and finite state space Markov chains, as well as conditional probability, common distributions, transformations of random variables, and moment generating functions. The subject is very theoretical and expects students to already have a strong math and probability background.	Professor Tsitsiklis\nMaterial	Problem sets\nNot much application	Students took this course to satisfy requirements or aid them in their research. Other students took it because Professor Tsitsiklis was teaching it or because they wanted to know more about probability. Students should take this course if they are interested in the mathematical fundamentals of probability and proofs of probability concepts, but they are warned that this course requires a strong math background and interest.	There were many problem sets, one due each week. They were long and difficult; exactly how difficult seemed to depend on the student's math background. They were helpful in learning the material. Some students collaborated.	There were no labs.	The grading policy was 20% problem sets, 35% midterm, 45% final exam. While some students thought the problem sets were sometimes graded unreasonably, most students thought grading was fair.	There was no official textbook. Class notes were organized, comprehensive, and very useful.	There was one midterm and one final. Although students were given previous years' exams to study, the midterm was different from and more difficult than previous years' exams. It was about the same difficulty as the problem sets, and similarly, a strong math background helped students a lot. The midterm was hard, but students thought it was fair.	"If you have rigorous math and can write proofs in your sleep, then the psets won't be a problem. Otherwise, prepare to cry, pray, beg."

Course staff\nDesign project	Tedious math in problem sets	Most students took this course to satisfy their EE header requirement, but a few also took it out of interest.	Problem sets were useful for learning the material, but solving questions often involved just finding the right equations and plugging and chugging through tedious math. Many students collaborated and went to office hours. Tutorials were helpful too.	The design project was very time-consuming, but many students enjoyed it and thought it really clarified the course material.

Five percent of the grade was based on attendance.	There was a textbook, available from CopyTech. It was useful for looking up equations, but students were frustrated that neither the table of contents nor the index were included. Class notes were also helpful.	The exams were open-book, which was convenient for students who didn't want to memorize all the necessary equations.

Resistive elements and networks; independent and dependent sources; switches and MOS devices; digital abstraction; amplifiers; and energy storage elements. Dynamics of first- and second-order networks; design in the time and frequency domains; analog and digital circuits and applications.\n\nThis subject is mandatory for all EECS students and is highly recommended to all engineers.\n\nThe prerequisites for this subject (8.02 and 18.03 or 18.06) are genuine and strictly enforced. \n\nMy teaching philosophy is to emphasize conceptual understanding and to motivate learning by conveying the exciting possibilities of the subject material. Although some of it is necessary, I like to deemphasize circuit solving drudgery, and instead focus on the intuitive solution process. I also emphasize hands-on learning through the lab projects and an online  experimental laboratory Websim. \n\nI encourage students to work together. Many students learn better this way. However, the work they turn in must be written up individually. I take a neutral stance on bibles -- they can be helpful if used as an aid to learning.\n	In 6.002, students learn all the basic tools for solving and designing circuits. Students build their own circuits from scratch in two labs assignments, with the help of lab assistants if necessary. Topics include Thevenin and Norton equivalence, superposition (of linear/ TI systems), linearizing non-linear components, small signal analysis, and static discipline.	Professor/TAs\nDemos\nRecitations\nBuilding an audio playback system\nSolid background on many different topics	Powerpoint lectures\nAncient lab equipment\nNot enough LAs\nLong hours for labs\nDifficulty of exams\n	Students took this subject mostly because it was a Course 6 requirement. They also wanted to gain a better understanding of how to apply EM to practical circuits. By the end, they were much more comfortable applying circuit models on a breadboard through labs.	Problem sets were of reasonable difficulty and length, and they were essential to understanding the lecture material. The book was extremely helpful, as it used all of the same terminology and notation (which was often not explained well in the assignment itself). Collaboration helped immensely. Problem sets increased in difficulty throughout the semester. Tutorials were very helpful. The problem sets counted for almost none of the grade, but were invaluable for learning the material.	Labs were very useful for gaining hands-on experience with circuits and seeing how circuits work in the real world. The assignments included building a digital-to-analog converter and an amplifier for a small speaker. The labs were fairly time consuming, and some students were frustrated with the tediousness of wiring and debugging. Lab equipment was not always reliable. TAs were really helpful though during lab hours.	Grading was fair, although students felt the weighting for problem sets (5% for 11 psets) and labs (5% for two labs) should be higher, considering how much time they spent on them. A lot of weight was placed on exams.	The textbook, which was written by the professor, was comprehensive and useful, but also very dense and long. Class notes were also useful, but they had fill-in-the-blank spots and they were not posted online.	Exams were tough, but representative of the material covered. They were a little less difficult than the problem sets. The tutorials, recitations, and problem sets were essential for doing well on the exams. To study, review past quizzes and see what kinds of circuit tricks they designed. Look over the problem sets and do lots of practice problems.	"C.Cooke is the man (the 6.002 man, anyway)."	Put more emphasis on psets and work through harder examples in lecture. More short labs - weekly labs lasting perhaps 1 or 2 hours with minimal post-lab write-ups would be very helpful in learning how actual circuits are built and function. Powerpoint lectures where the lecturer just points and lectures are significantly less interesting than traditional blackboard lectures. Introduce more applications of the circuits they learned in class so that they could better understand why learning it was useful. Post lecture notes. Change the way grades are distributed. 		f	f	core	12	4	\N	\N	Yes, objectives clearly defined and followed. Students liked the semester plan.

It emphasizes design, but also covers problem analysis and implementation. The style of the course is principled but pragmatic: students learn fundamental design concepts and patterns in the context of realistic systems. Through projects, students become familiar with standard development tools (such as Eclipse, JUnit, and Subversion) and gain exposure to a wide array of technologies, including networking, databases, concurrency, and GUIs. The course assumes a basic proficiency in programming, but doesn't assume prior knowledge of Java. \n\nThe key concepts that we hope students take away are: that upfront design pays dividends, and provides a constructive step to code, using standard patterns; that decoupling is the essence of code design; and that adherence to well-defined paradigms makes programs more robust and easier to understand.\n	6.005 teaches students good software development practices. Topics include producing correct readable code, modularization, debugging, and testing. Many students felt that while there was plenty of theory and application, the connection between the two was not always apparent, and some students had to research on their own or teach themselves.	Projects\nProfessors\nMaterial	Problem sets\nTime consuming\nBad groups	Students took this course to satisfy a requirement or to gain programming experience. Future students are advised to know Java or a Java-like language, to have plenty of time (not only for work, but also to accommodate teammates' schedules), and to begin assignments early.	There were two kinds of individual assignments: Explorations and Problem Sets. Explorations allowed more flexibility in coding style and exposed students to new ideas and implementations. Problem sets tested how well students understood the material from lecture. Both were time-intensive. Students complained that problem sets were sometimes poorly worded or that the necessary material was presented too late.	The labs and group projects were interesting and useful in learning the material, and they were reasonable in length. Some students had trouble dealing with teammates.	Grading seemed inconsistent and arbitrary, appearing to be dependent on the grader. Students sometimes would not know what they were losing points for. Despite this, many students thought the grading policy was fair.	There was no textbook. The class notes were clear and useful.	There were no quizzes.

We explore MOS and bipolar transistors as well as the analysis and design of digital and amplifier circuits.  6.012 is a header subject.  It is required for 6.1 students and is taken by a large fraction of 6.2 students.  It lays the foundation for microelectronics.  Students with an interest in understanding the underlying principles of integrated circuit technology or those who want to study further in the area of microelectronics devices and/or circuits should take 6.012.  I would like students to remember that learning physical intuition along with the math demonstrates a deep understanding.  The physics, models and circuits were all explained with both intuition and the equations that govern their operation.  Students are encouraged to collaborate.  They are asked to put the name of the person that they collaborated with on their Psets.  I always try to update the material and eliminate material without eliminating the underlying concepts.

We cover deterministic and stochastic signal processing, image processing, and statistical inference. This elective is of interest to students who want opportunities for hands-on application of signal processing techniques and experience with real-world biomedical problems. Students should take this course to prepare for work in an academic or commercial environment where they will need to analyze biomedical signals and/or medical images. Our goal is to give students a toolbox and the knowledge of when to use each tool so that they have skills to approach new problems/applications with signal processing techniques appropriate to their current problem/application. Lectures provide theoretical material and background on physiological and medical systems, as well as real-world examples from guest lecturers working in the field. Labs are done with partners but written up independently. Partners may share figures, Matlab code, and ideas but not the text of lab reports. Group work is okay for homework problem sets. 6.003 or equivalent is required as a prerequisite. Familiarity with probability and statistics is helpful. The class can be taken before or after 6.011/6.341 as it gives practical aspects of some theoretical topics covered in those courses.	An overview of biomedical signal processing.  Students learn how to extract information from noisy sources in biomedical problems.  Applications in ECG, speech, and brain MRI processing.  Broad overview; not much depth.	Julie Greenberg\nLabs	No tutorials\nLong lab reports	Students took the class to learn about the breadth of signal processing applications in biomedical engineering.  Some took it to satisfy a masters' requirement.	Problem sets were useful for learning the material and were considered fairly easy.  Collaboration helped; no bible needed.	The labs were well-designed and many students felt they were the highlight of the course.  The lab reports were somewhat long but the labs were beneficial to the students' understanding of the material.	Grading was fair and it was based heavily on labs.	Class notes were thorough; sometimes they were too detailed, in fact.  They were good as as a reference, not for general reading.  The professor's lecture notes were considered quite helpful.	Quizzes were fair.  They were largely conceptual and it was difficult to get partial credit since one either understood the material or didn't.  The quizzes were only worth about 25% of the grade, though.  Students said that reviewing problem sets and lecture notes was adequate preparation.	"Labs were probably the best part of the course.  I felt that most of the learning in the course took place by completing them."	Course notes were not that helpful (too much detail).

It is a chance to remember why you came to MIT:  to learn and to build cool systems.  We study the design and construction of power electronic circuits and motor drives.  Laboratory exercises include the construction of drive circuit for an electric go-cart, flash strobes, computing power supplies, three-phase inverters for AC motors, and resonant drives for lamp ballasts and induction heating.  We examine basic electric machines including DC, induction, and permanent magnet motors. As a member of this class, you'll complete a sequence of assigned projects, followed by a final project of your choice, emphasizing creativity and uniqueness.\n\nThe overarching goal of this class is to share with you the skills and techniques that designers use to make useful systems that solve problems for people.  These are the skills that will make you successful in an engineering career.  They empower you to see the value of analysis techniques you have learned.   Your experience in this class will teach you to use analytical methods to constrain problems in ways that lead to winning solutions – answers that makes your UROP project successful, that make your thesis work, that make your product a commercial success, that let you stand flat-footed in front of a problem and fight to win.\n\nPower electronic circuits are the backbone of almost every modern convenience.  Automobiles, cell-phones, laptop and desktop computers, television sets, and kitchen appliances, among many other systems, require power electronics circuits to convert electrical energy to a useful form.  \n\nThe creation of a successful power electronic circuit almost always requires more than the application of a set of analytical techniques. The most elegant examples are crafted by engineers who have a rich understanding of how to make trade-offs amongst all the parts of a system, e.g,, thermal, mechanical, electrical, and sometimes software.  For this reason, we make special efforts to expose you to a huge number of demonstrations developed from a wide range of engineering disciplines, and to provide exciting laboratory experiences that let you try the techniques you learn on practical hardware.  \n\n	A good balance of theory and practice: you learn to design and build (and appreciate!) power electronics.

The first half is devoted to various cellular transport mechanisms, including diffusion, osmosis, carrier mediated transport, and ion transport across cell membranes. The second half is devoted to the basics of signal transduction in neurons, including Hodgkin-Huxley model and action potential, myelinated and unmyelinated fiber, and biophysics of ion channels. This course is a course 6 header for the bioelectrical engineering concentration. Students need to take this course to learn the basics of cellular physiology in order to prepare further studies in this area. As an elective this course will provide quantitative insights on basic cellular physiology, as well as an introduction to the fundamentals of neuroscience. Students who are interested in biomedical / biological engineering / neuroscience as their future career path should take this course. We focus/stress more on quantitative understanding of biological systems, therefore requiring certain mathematical/engineering backgrounds at the level of 18.03 or 6.002. This course is great for students who thrive in projects / experiments, which is a significant part of the course. We spend a lot of time in the projects, where students have a chance to apply what they learn in the lectures in solving the problem they chose. This is a great way to learn the two important themes. 1) Biological systems (cells) can be understood in quantitative terms. 2) Biological systems are complicated because of multiple driving forces / factors involved. While students are expected to submit their own work as homeworks and exams, projects are done in pairs collaborating toward the common goal. Students in a group will receive the same overall project grades. In doing so, students will learn how to collaborate with a partner, which is an important skill but not often taught or emphasized. Use of bibles (if there is any) is discouraged since students will lose the chance to test their own understanding before the exams, which usually contain new problems. \r\n\r\n	The class focuses on the transport of materials across membranes, as well as the other methods of cellular communication such as electrical stimulation.

Problem sets were useful in learning the material and reasonable in length and difficulty.	Some students found the labs helpful, but many felt the labs were too long, difficult, or involved too much busy work.	Most students found the grading policy fair.  Several commented about the harsh late policies, and a few suggested that the problem sets should have been given more weight in the final grade.	Some found the textbook to be well-written, and easy to understand, but several found it to be too long.  A considerable number reported that they did not use the textbook at all during the course.	Student generally found the exams fair, although many also found them long and difficult.

Students stressed that people wanting to take the class should be prepared to 1) spend time doing the readings and 2) show up to class, as class attendance was mandatory.	There were two assignments per week. Each assignment consisted of a reading and a one-page assignment. The readings were scholarly papers that took time to read and understand. Many students said it was hard at first to extract the important material from papers, but that they became much better at it as the semester went on.  Writing assignments often took on themes, such as recommendation letters and letters to important people. Students found it interesting and useful to learn different types of communication skills.	There was a term project for graduate students taking the class. Students said that it was of reasonable length and self-directed. It was an open-ended project relating to artificial intelligence.

It focuses on quantum communication, especially as tied to quantum optics.  It is one of a set of restricted electives for students in the Interdisciplinary Quantum Information Science and Engineering (iQuISE) Program, and, more generally, is of interest to students in both communications and optics.  No prior knowledge of quantum mechanics is required; the subject is built on foundations of linear algebra, probability, and linear systems theory.  Students who complete this class are in a position to begin research in areas such as quantum information theory, quantum imaging, and nonclassical light generation. In the future, a hands-on laboratory experience in quantum optics will be incorporated into the class, allowing students to do some of the fundamental experiments with entangled light beams whose theory is developed in class.	The course fulfilled students expectations of learning about quantum communications and topics including Dirac notations, coherent states, squeezed states, quantum secrecy and other applications.

Applications are drawn from aerospace, mechanical, fluid-dynamics, electrical, and biomedical sciences. Topics include mathematical formulations (techniques for automatic assembly of mathematical problems from physics' principles); sparse, direct and iterative solution techniques for linear systems; Newton methods for nonlinear problems; integration of ordinary differential equations, periodic steady state analysis; model order reduction; integral equation methods; finite difference and finite element methods.\n\nPrerequisites are some Calculus and Ordinary Differential Equations (e.g. 18.03). In addition any previous Linear Algebra (e.g. 18.06) will be very useful, although all the required linear algebra concepts will be reviewed in class with emphasis on their physical interpretation. Some basic knowledge of MATLAB can also be useful, although introductory tutorial sessions will be offered for students without previous experience.\n\nThe core teaching philosophy is 'learning by doing'. Most of the learning of the material will occur while trying to solve the problem sets. Problem sets typically consist of implementation of the algorithms discussed in class on example applications. Often we provide code infrastructure such as parsers or non-optimized core numerical code. Students can then simply focus on the development or improvement of the core numerical algorithm. Creative solutions are strongly encouraged and never penalized.\nStudents are strongly encouraged to work in small groups. Every student is however required to write their own code and report. Final grades are mainly based on effort on problem sets and are not curved.\n\nCompared to other numerical simulation classes, this class will focus significantly more on practical aspects, such as on how to assemble automatically a system to be solved from first principle laws. A second fundamental difference with other numerical simulation classes is that this class will dedicate a substantial attention to numerical techniques that can be used on extremely large problems.	The subject provides an introduction to mathematical techniques for engineering problems. The class has a great balance of theory and application, with students having to solve problem sets in MATLAB. Students appreciated the discussion of practical applications, but some felt lectures were too theoretical and some thought the quantity of material was overwhelming.

Students are encouraged to collaborate and utilize office hours.	None	Grading policy was very fair. Problem sets were graded based on 'effort'.

It is frequently taken by graduate students from outside of engineering who wish to learn more about computation and programming.	The class provided an introduction to programming and computer science. The class was taught using Python, but theoretical concepts in algorithms, probability, and graph theories were touched upon.

Many students did not know that lecture notes existed, and listed lecture notes as a suggestion for the class in future semesters. Students who did read the textbook found it very helpful, however.	Most students said the quizzes were not directly related to lectures and class materials, however, the consensus remained that they were fair. The exams were considered difficult and tricky, especially with coding questions where students were expected to read code and figure out what it did, or write code on paper. Still, it seems the quizzes were more focused on theory instead of coding. Recitations and review sessions were found to be helpful with preparing for the quizzes.

Students felt that the grading policy was mostly fair, although some students felt that the calculation of the final class grade was somewhat ambiguous. However, recitation participation and design project grades were somewhat arbitrary.	The textbook was very hard to read for many students because it was extremely verbose, but at the same time, it contained useful information. The textbook contained material very similar to what was presented in lecture. The class notes received mixed reviews, ranging from useless to very good.

There were no problem sets for this class.	Labs were fun and well-designed. Labs were very important in learning the lecture material. The level of difficulty of the labs was not evenly distributed throughout the term. Apart from that, most of the students enjoyed the labs and found them really cool. Some students complained that the hardware caused difficulties. 	Most people found the grading to be fair and that the midterm grade report helped. There weren't really any rubrics, but it was clear what was expected. Some students were not clear on how their performance on the final project was measured.	There were no readings for this class.

Everything needs feedback. You will never design an electronic or an electromechanical system that does not include a feedback loop, either explicitly or implicitly.\n\nEvery interface to the real world --- whether you are building a robot arm, a temperature control system, an audio power amp, or an RF synthesizer (the list goes on and on) --- needs to drive some kind of actuator --- a motor, a heater, a power transistor, or an oscillator. To make sure that actuator is doing the right thing, you need to measure the output (its position, its temperature, its voltage, or its frequency) and compare that measurement to what you meant to do. In other words, you need feedback.	6.302 covered classical feedback control systems, building on the concepts taught in 6.003. It taught methods of analyzing and improving system stability, including Bode plot analysis and root locus. Students found the subject matter a bit antiquated, and some wished the class would discuss modern control theory in more detail.	Steven Herbst\nMaglev lab\nProfessor Roberge	Disorganization\nGrading (or lack thereof)\nRon Roscoe\nDry lectures	Students took this class as an introduction to feedback systems and classical control theory without too much math. Some were interested especially in the maglev lab.	Problem sets were helpful for understanding the material, but sometimes had errors or were unclear. Most students found that collaboration was necessary, and enjoyed the use of Piazza for that purpose. While not particularly difficult, most students thought the problem sets were long and somewhat repetitive.	Students in general did not enjoy the motor labs. While they did provide an application of the theory in the class, the black box nature of the control boxes made it difficult to gain much intuition. Students also felt that the use of outdated analog oscilloscopes made the labs more tedious and time consuming than they should have been.\n\nHowever, most students found the final lab (maglev or PLL) an interesting and fun project. They liked that it brought together many concepts from the course, and produced a cool end product. However, some students would have liked more organization in the final lab, including some sort of lab kit.	Students found grading fair, but complained that the lack of graders made it much slower than it should have been.	Students loved the course notes by Kent Lundberg, and wished that they were available online.	Students thought that the exams were fair in difficulty and similar to the problem sets. Studying in advance was definitely a must, as the course covers a lot of material.	[About Ron Roscoe] At times you'll ask, "why is he talking about radios?" but then a gem will come out that you'll remember for life.\n6.302 is your knighthood into engineering. "I dub thee, engineer."	Students suggested that lectures should be made more dynamic and organized. Additionally, they felt the lectures would be better if they covered material in advance of recitations/problem sets, rather than lagging behind.	http://web.mit.edu/6.302/www/	f	f	CIR	12	4	\N	\N	Students felt that the class topics and schedule mirrored the course notes.

This subject covers common and basic mathematical models that have been used to analyze such networks. Students get the opportunity to explore particular application domains in their term projects.	This class had a large focus on probabilistic models of networks, with some focus on applications of networks.  The lecture topics varied substantially from one lecture to the next, which some students thought was not ideal.  The subject material also touched on graph theory, which some students would have preferred that the class had gone more in depth into.	Professors\nTsitsiklis' lectures\nGood coverage of range of topics	No good textbook\nNo typed lecture notes\nNot enough applications\nVague problem sets	Most students took this class as a way to prepare for future research in networks.  Some were just interested in networks in general.  The class was less interesting for those more interested in the systems aspect of networks.	The consensus was that problem sets were challenging but doable, especially through collaboration with classmates.  The problems were useful for learning the material.  In total there were 5 problem sets, and some students thought more problems sets would have helped to understand the material taught in lecture at a deeper level.	The class had one final project that brought together the topics taught throughout the course.  The project was a good transition into research for those taking that path.  It was an open ended assignment that allowed the students to expand on a topic they found interesting.	The grading was perceived by most to be fair.	The textbooks were claimed by most to be either too mathematically obscure or too wordy, and in general did not meet the needs of the students.  The texts were supplemented with additional readings assigned by the professors, which were more relevant and helpful.  Some felt that it was difficult to keep up with the readings.	The students unanimously agreed that the midterm exam was difficult.  The problems were at a similar level to those on problem sets.  One of the most common comments was that the time constraint (2 hrs) made the test especially challenging.  There was no final exam.	"Tsitsiklis is an amazing lecturer. Makes complicated things seem easy."	There were several requests for typed notes, possibly as a replacement for the textbooks, but still to be supplemented with papers.  Some students enjoyed the second half of the course better and requested a heavier emphasis on that content, possibly with the combination of some game theory elements.  There were some concerns about the inconsistency between the way proofs were done in class and what was acceptable on problem sets.	http://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/6/sp11/6.986/	f	f	CTL	12	0	\N	\N	The students all agreed that the class adhered to the stated objectives well.

The material, especially parallelism\nLeiserson\n	Heavy workload\nGrading\nBuggy code	The class fulfilled 6-3 lab and AUS requirements. Students were also interested in learning C, C++, and parallelism.	There was one problem set; the other homework assignments were projects. Some students complained that it overlapped with other assignments. The problem set's reception was mixed - some students found it helpful, but others did not derive much utility from it.	The class had several group projects. Students thought the material they covered was interesting and very useful. However, debugging them could be extremely time-consuming, and staff-provided code sometimes had issues. Students reported that finding a good team was essential for success.	Projects were the most heavily weighted part of the grade. They were graded on correctness, code quality, and performance. Performance grades were assigned along a distribution where the slowest code got a 0 and the fastest code got a 100 - some students argued that this was unfair and could be arbitrary in the case where all projects are equally performant. Incorrect code did not receive performance points, which some students saw as too harsh.	There was no textbook, but students found the course notes and lecture slides to be fairly useful. However, the notes were posted late and sometimes had mistakes.	There were two exams that covered theoretical material taught in lecture. Most students thought the difficulty was reasonable. Some students felt that the second exam covered less relevant material than the first one.	"[Professor Leiserson] wrote the book on parallelization."	Students suggested reducing the project workload, or redesigning the schedule so that projects do not overlap. A justification for overlapping projects is that they simulate work in the real world, but some students gave the counterargument that having multiple classes already simulates work environments. Students also recommended making project grading more lenient, and eliminating the competitive aspect it had.	http://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/6/fa11/6.172/	f	t	SYS	12	12	\N	\N	The course's objectives were to teach performance engineering, and students felt that it fulfilled this goal.

Fredo\nHands-on projects\nPretty pictures	Lectures\nSo Much Debugging\nLong assignments	Students took this class because they were interested in the subject, and because it satisfies the AUS requirement. Some students also took the class to help them learn C++.	The problem sets consisted of lengthy coding assignments. They were very useful in learning the material and could be quite fun and rewarding because of the tangible results. However, they were time consuming and often required a lot of debugging. STARTING EARLY is highly encouraged. The problem sets were worth 80% of the final grade.	N/A	The grading policy seemed very fair. Some students felt that the value of extra credit points was unclear.	The class did not have an official textbook and students were frustrated by this fact. However, the lecture notes were extremely helpful especially for exams and problem sets. \nOn the other hand, the Big Red Book of OpenGL is recommended reading and free online. The available power-point slides were hard to read for those that did not attend class.  	There was one quiz and one final exam, each worth 10% of the final grade.

They were helpful for learning the material and fairly representative of what would be on the exams. Students found collaboration helpful.	There were no labs.	Grading was described as fair and even lax by some because of the generous number of students in the class who got an A (50%) and opportunities for extra credit.	The class was divided in their opinions of the textbook. The textbook assigned for the first half of the class, Sipser, was useful to some but unhelpful, even unreadable, for others. There was no official textbook for the second half of the class. Students were also ambivalent about the online class notes: some thought they were great but others felt they were poorly kept and that being from a previous semester, they didn't follow the lectures well.	There was one midterm that was similar to the psets but harder. The average was low (between 60-70 out of 140 points), though students thought it was graded fairly.	On the first day of class, Aaronson said, "There are many classes at MIT that teach you how to do really useful things in the real world and will make you a better programmer - this is NOT one of those classes. 6.045 is meant to blow your mind."

Many students reported that the problem sets were difficult and time-consuming and that collaboration, office hours, and access to previous years' material were very helpful, while others reported that the problem sets were straightforward and didn't require collaboration. Several comments described the problem sets as satisfying and helpful for learning the material, although a few described them as annoying and a repetition of the in-class problems. Problem sets also became more difficult as the semester progressed. Missed points added weight to the midterm and final.	There were no labs in this class.	Most students considered the grading policy fair. The larger grade constituents were the final (25%), problem sets (25%), class participation (20%), mini-quizzes (10%) and the midterm (10%). While the grade distribution had never been explicitly discussed, students had heard that around a third of the students get A's and most get B's. Grading involved a subjective component - if a student had been very active in giving reading comments, this could raise the grade.	Readings in this class were exceptionally important due to the lack of lectures. Fortunately, the online textbook was useful (if a bit dense) and had funny anecdotes which made it an enjoyable read. It was, however, a work-in-progress, and did not have answers to problems at the ends of the chapters.	There were weekly mini-quizzes on the previous week's material, daily micro-quizzes on the day's reading, and a midterm. Opinions on the daily micro-quizzes were generally negative, with students reporting that they tested trivial material and weren't a good measure of whether a student had done the reading. The weekly mini-quizzes, however, were considered a fair test of understanding, and students agreed that it forced them to keep up with the material. Opinions on the difficulty of the mini-quizzes varied; some students liked them and felt they only required a good comprehension of the readings, while others found them unpleasant and said they required substantial preparation. Like the mini-quizzes, the midterm was considered a good test of the material but opinions on the difficulty varied. Several students cautioned against making small mistakes due to the unforgiving grading.	"If you don't learn well through reading this will be a very hard class for you."\n\n"Quizzes every single day? The amount of (unnecessary) stress that this class put on me is ridiculous."\n\n"Do not like teal."\n\n"Teal actually works!"	The most frequent suggestions involved eliminating TEAL, although in other parts of the feedback people reported good experiences with TEAL. One suggestion was to allow students to switch groups midway through the term, as was done in 8.02 TEAL. Students overwhelmingly disliked the class' heavy reliance on self-teaching - the video lectures, for instance, were considered indispensable, and many students struggled once they stopped being posted. Students also mentioned that while the subject material was interesting, the frequent mini-quizzes, micro-quizzes and participation scores made it very stressful. In particular, students complained about having a problem set due in the same week as a midterm. Sentiments on NB were mixed; some students felt they were a good way to force people to do the reading, while others felt that relying on comments on NB to boost grades was whimsical. Finally, a few students mentioned that the microquizzes did not accurately measure whether they had done the readings; if they did not understand the readings, they could not do the microquizzes.

Some lectures were designated guest &quot;spiritual&quot; or &quot;right now&quot; lectures that talked about current research in the field or more philosophical implications of artificial intelligence. 	Professor Winston\nLabs\nMakeup quizzes on the final	Grading scheme	Most students took 6.034 because it was a required Course 6-3 header. Other students wanted to learn more about artificial intelligence.	There were six problem sets which were mostly concentrated in beginning and middle of the course. Students generally found the problem sets straightforward and helpful. Some students felt that the problem sets were inconsistent, ranging from easy and useful to tedious and unhelpful.	There were no labs in 6.034. Sometimes the problem sets were referred to as &quot;labs&quot;.	The final grade for 6.034 was weighted 4/7 toward the &quot;core&quot; material tested through problems in four quizzes, 2/7 toward &quot;spiritual&quot; or &quot;right now&quot; material tested through multiple choice questions in three quizzes, and 1/7 toward problem sets. Each score was converted to a 0-5 scale for the purposes of weighting. Students found the grading generally fair. Some students felt that the spiritual and right now material was weighted too much for what amounted to around 24 multiple choice questions compared to the problem sets, which took significantly longer.	There was an online textbook as well as class notes posted for a small subsection of the lectures. Students generally did not find the textbook helpful, but found the notes helpful when they were posted. Some other students found resources on OCW helpful. Some students felt that notes were purposely not provided in order to punish those who skipped lecture.	There were four quizzes throughout the semester. Each numerical score on a quiz was converted to a number on a 0-5 scale. The final offered a chance to retake each of the sections, and the higher of the two scores was used. There were many practice quizzes posted, which students found to be very helpful in preparing for exams. The &quot;core&quot; concepts of the class were evaluated with short answer problems, while the spiritual and right now lectures were evaluated with multiple choice questions. Some students felt that multiple choice questions were not a good way to evaluate those lectures, which were primarily discussion based.\n	"THE BEST LECTURES EVER. No, seriously, I have never had a class with more engaging, inspirational lectures. I have been motivated to work on several side projects relating to AI now."\n\n"Before taking this course, I was wary of AI because I thought that it would be too complicated to grasp. But Professor Winston made learning about AI a simple and fun experience that I will remember forever."\n\n"This class isn't very friendly to lecture skippers. There are notes for lectures, but they are reading materials and not lecture notes for that lecture. Also, Right Now lectures have no notes."	Suggestions from students generally focused on the grading or the availability of course material. Most students who commented about grading felt that the weighting of the Spiritual and Right Now questions was too much (2/7 of the final grade) for only approximately 24 multiple choice questions. Students who commented on the course material wished that there were either video-recorded lectures and tutorials, or more comprehensive course notes posted.	http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.034/	t	f	core	12	4	\N	\N	6.034 followed its stated objectives.

There were some writing assignments which students felt were good for learning the material.	There were no labs in this class. The final project was a good learning experience, but many students found it stressful.	The grading policy was a little vague. Many students had not received grades at the point they were writing reviews. In the end, grades were determined almost entirely by the final paper. 	The class was entirely based on online readings, which students found useful. Skimming was an essential skill.	There were no quizzes in this class.	"This subject content is truly fantastic. The instructors did a fantastic job of teaching law to a bunch of MIT students with no law background... even if it was using the firehose technique."	The writing instructors could have served a more useful purpose. There seemed to be too many. Perhaps more legal explanation would have been nice in the beginning. Much of the &quot;Washington Terminology&quot; could have been brought in earlier.

Some considered the class distant from electrical engineering as it was an overview of various models for mass transport and cell electrical properties. The first half of the subject seemed disconnected from the second half. Students found the class helpful for understanding cellular behavior from an electrical perspective.	Joe Steinmeyer\nHodgkin-Huxley Project	Microfluidics Project	Most students took the class because it was both an EE header and a CI-M. Many were interested in the applications of electrical engineering to biology and neuroscience.	The problem sets were useful in learning the material. Most students considered them comprehensive, well-written, and helpful in preparing for the exams. Students found that a combination of going to lecture and reading the textbook helped for succeeding on the problem sets.	There were two lab projects for the course. The first was a microfluidics lab with an accompanying report. The second was a MATLAB simulation of the cell with an accompanying presentation. Most students found the labs, particularly the latter one, fun and helpful for learning the material.	Grading was fair.	Most students thought the textbook was excellent; it explained concepts well and went more in depth than the lectures. Some said that the textbook was key for doing well in the course and understanding the concepts. Others found that the textbook was too mathematically intensive, which contrasted with the intuition-based approach the class attempted to develop.	There was only one midterm and one final. Students generally found the exams comprehensive and fair, although many remarked that they were also challenging and long. 	"Joe was an awesome teacher. I think he is probably the single best lecturer I have had at MIT."\n\n"The lectures were engaging. It's the most I've ever participated during a technical class."	Students remarked that lecture often finished in a half hour and would appreciate slower lectures with more examples that took up the entire time. Some students noted that the problem sets were similar or the exact same as past years and wished for there to be new problems. Students were mixed in their feelings about the structure of the labs and the number of midterms for the class, although they were generally satisfied with the timeline.		t	f	core	12	4	\N	\N	The class followed the outlined objectives.

Design project\nSubject material	Device physics\nBig project AND final exam\nPoor problem set feedback	Students took this class because it fulfilled the header degree requirement for 6-1 and 6-2 and interest in the material. 	Students found the problem sets to be difficult, but very useful for learning the material. Some disliked how problem sets were due the same weeks as exams. 	There were no labs, but there was a large design project. Students felt that the project was a lot of work, but very worthwhile as applying what they learned in class really helped solidify their knowledge. 	Students felt like the problem sets were graded fairly and wished that the design project had been worth more. 	Students thought that the textbook was dense and not as useful as the course notes. Some also felt that the recitation notes were very useful. 	Students felt that the exams were difficult and required lots of preparation. Many recommended going over problem sets and exams from past years. 	"[The design project] was a huge pain, but the right kind of huge pain."	Students felt like the lecture style relied too much on slides, and wished that  the board had been used more. Some also wanted more emphasis on concepts as opposed to calculations. Students also expressed frustration at mistakes in the textbook and study materials.

Some students remarked that the class felt like a random survey of lots of tangentially related algorithms and wished that the material was more cohesively tied together as 6.006 was.	Course content\nProfessor Devadas	Difficult exams\nLack of feedback	Students took 6.046 because it was a requirement for Courses 18C and 6-3.	Students found the problem sets helpful in learning the material and of an appropriate length. Most students found the problems fairly challenging and collaborated with friends to come up with solutions. Students remarked that the write-up of a solution often took longer than finding the solution itself but felt that the write-up was a useful exercise in understanding the material.	There were no labs in this course.	The grading was considered fair, but students found the slow grading and lack of feedback frustrating. The averages were low and students were not given any information as to how numerical grades would translate into letter grades.	The textbook for the class was the &quot;Introduction to Algorithms&quot; book often referred to as CLRS. Students found the textbook to be a great and useful reference. Handwritten lecture notes were also posted, which students also found helpful.	There was one in-class midterm, one take-home midterm, and a final. Students found the first exam  difficult to finish given the time constraint. The take-home was also considered long and difficult, and students wished they had more problem set feedback to know what their write-ups should have looked like. Students generally found the grading fair for both exams.	"I totally fell in love with Algorithms in this class."\n\n"First exam was in class and was very long, most people didn't finish. Second exam was a take-home exam and was both long and incredibly difficult. Prepare to spend a huge chunk of time on it."	Feedback was generally focused on feedback and the course content. Many students found the lack of feedback on problem sets and exams frustrating and felt that it left them unprepared for the take-home exam.

Many commented on their helpfulness for learning the material, and on their usefulness for exam preparation.  Students repeatedly recommended collaborating on the problem sets.\n\nStudents rated the problem sets at a wide range of difficulty levels, from "straightforward" to "extremely difficult".  Some remarked that the problem sets were easy with prior discrete math experience, but hard otherwise.	There are no labs for this class.	Most students described grading as lenient. Some appreciated the fact that poor problem set performance could be made up on exams. Some commented that grading was in fact *too* lenient - due to the percentile-based letter grades, you needed quite a high score to get an A. The cutoffs became lower after the final.\n\nSeveral students complained that grading was slow.	The course notes are the official textbook for 6.042.  Students generally found them helpful and straightforward.  Several emphasized the fact that they are free.  A minority of students did not like the course notes, and chose instead to learn from the lecture videos.	6.042 had a microquiz every lecture.

Although the class was taught using Java, there is less of a focus on learning Java than on understanding general programming principles.  Among other subjects, students learn about abstraction, representation invariance, testing, debugging, and modular design in 6.170.  Opinion on the balance between application and theory in 6.170 was mixed with equal numbers of students claiming that the class was too application oriented, overly theory oriented, and properly balanced.   	The Eclipse environment\r\nNo tests. No final\r\nLearning about software design	Sacrificing all your free time to this class\r\n20+ hours problem sets	Most students took 6.170 to satisfy the Course VI Department Lab requirement.  Other took the class because they wanted to learn principles of large scale software design or wanted to improve their programming skills.  Students felt that 6.170 was also an attractive asset to have when looking for a job.	The problem sets were remarkably time intensive.  Although problem sets were useful and emphasized class concepts, many students felt that they could be tedious and were often much longer than they needed to be.  Opinions on collaboration were divided.  Many students felt that it was not necessary to collaborate, while others maintained that collaboration helped catch bugs and refine coding strategy.\r\n\r\n	In place of regular labs, 6.170 had group final projects due at the end of the semester.  Last semester, students were assigned to complete an RSS client.  The fact that students only had one project to choose from upset some students.  The final design project took a lot of time and was described by several students as being unreasonable in length.  Students emphasized the importance of assembling a good group that was able to meet frequently.  Many students learned a lot from the final project and even said that it was a lot of fun while others claimed that it was a fruitless waste of time.\r\n	Opinion was split on grading in 6.170.  Many students felt that grading was completely fair.  Others, however, lamented the fact that grading was not predictable and varied widely between TAs.  In addition, some students felt that grading provided little feedback and that expectations on problem sets were not always clear.\r\n	The class text, &quot;Effective Java Programming Language Guide&quot; by Bloch was very helpful to some students while others did not realize that the text was required for the class.  Many students also cited Liskov's and Guttag's &quot;Program Development in Java&quot; as an excellent text.

Substantial laboratory experiments illustrated the role of abstraction and modularity in engineering design. Students gained practical experience in building reliable systems using imperfect components; selecting appropriate design metrics; choosing effective representations for information; and evaluating tradeoffs in complex systems. Topics included physical characterization and modeling of transmission systems in the time and frequency domains; analog and digital signaling; coding; detecting and correcting errors; relating information transmission rate to signal power, bandwidth and noise; and engineering of packet-switched networks.	6.02 was taught in three sections focusing on coding, signals and systems, and networks. Lectures were mostly theoretical while problem sets covered practical applications of electrical communications.

Problem sets included a coding portion, which often took students a long time to complete. Students needed to plan ahead to give themselves enough time to finish their assignments on time. Problems were also often poorly worded and ambiguous, and answers to problems that involved math were difficult to input inside the text boxes provided. Students thought collaboration was really useful and necessary to get problem sets completed in time. Going to office hours also helped students a lot. 	There were no labs in this course. 	Most students thought that the grading was fair. 	There was no textbook, but class notes were available to the class. Students thought the notes were very helpful for completing problem sets and were occasionally more useful than the lecture material. 	There were three midterms during the semester. While most students thought that the first midterm was reasonable, some students felt that the second midterm was too long and difficult. Students who had experience with signals and systems found the midterms to be easier than those who did not. Practice problems for the midterms also did not have solutions, which made studying for the midterms difficult. 		Students would have liked to see the signals and systems portion of the class taught more clearly. A common suggestion was for the lecturers to use the chalkboard to explain concepts rather than use slides. Problem sets could have also been more helpful for students if they had clearer instructions and were shorter.

The labs were very useful in helping students better understand the material, although students did not think that the labs helped them prepare for quizzes. Students felt that, on average, labs took too long to complete. In particular, lab 6, designing the beta processor, is notorious for taking a long time and requiring a lot of debugging. Labs used the class software, JSIM and BSIM, and could be completed on students' personal computers or on the athena desktops.	The grading policy was strictly point based, and the grade cutoffs were made clear at the beginning of the semester. Labs were automatically graded, and each lab needed to be completed in order to pass the class. Students found this system to be very fair and liked that they could see where they stood at any time.	There were no assigned readings for this course. However, the course site had links several reference sheets for different topics and a useful handbook written by a previous 6.004 TA, Margaret Chong. Lecture slides were also posted on the course website. Many students wished for an official textbook or set of notes.	Quizzes followed the format of those in years past.

Grading was done in a unique way where points build up to certain grade cutoff values. Students generally appreciated the easy-to-understand system, praising its transparency and fairness; however, some students disliked that the grades were weighted so heavily towards the quizzes, which can be graded harshly. Quizzes were consistently graded the the same day as administered. A student's current grade was always available online. 	Very few people used the textbook, especially after the first couple of topics. Some students found the class notes useful, but still recommended going to recitation. There were also online practice questions which were helpful for quiz preparation.	Many students found the quizzes challenging, but most agreed that they succeeded in testing the material well.

Students learned more from 6.115 than nearly every other class at the Institute, thanks to excellent lectures and painstaking labs.  The first eight weeks of the course consisted of labs that threw students directly into dense material, and required them to work extraordinarily long hours.  The remainder of the course was dedicated to an open-ended final project, in which students could build nearly anything they wanted.  The project demonstration day at the end of the semester exhibited the ingenuity, creativity, passion and grit that defines the Institute.

Students generally felt that the labs were interesting and very edifying, but often seemed frustrated by the amount of time required to complete them.  Debugging often proved to be the most tedious and difficult part.  In addition to the labs, there was a final project in which students built something of their own design.  Many students felt that this was the most rewarding part of the entire course and one of the most memorable projects of their MIT careers thus far.	Students found the grading to be tough, but fair.  The course syllabus outlined exactly how performance on the quiz, labs, and final projects contributed to the final grade.  A large number of students found that the quiz was too hard and was weighted far too heavily with respect to the labs.	The lecture notes and course textbook were occasionally useful.  Most students found the 8051 reference manual to be critical to completing the course successfully.	There was a single quiz, covering nearly all of the material taught in the class.  The majority of students disliked the quiz, and often reported that it was too long to be completed in the allotted 50 minutes.  They found the questions to be rather difficult, and some students thought there was too much emphasis on "trick questions" and "tracking down edge cases".  Other students lamented the lack of study materials and the dearth of practice exams.  The quiz was worth 25% of students' overall grade, which fact that many, many students found to be unfair.

Topics covered included programming concepts, Linear time-invariant (LTI) systems, circuits and circuit theory, and probability. The majority of classtime was spent in lab, where students are assigned a partner and work together to program robots to accomplish certain goals. 6.01 was a challenging class, but many students found the material enjoyable and the labs instructive. 	Hands-on labs\r\nAdam Hartz	Difficult quizzes and exams\r\nBuggy software/hardware\r\nTimed labs\r\n	Students took this class to satisfy a core Course VI requirement.	Most students found the problem sets very helpful for getting a better understanding of the material, but could be pretty difficult. The problem sets were graded and submitted online and included an environment for writing and testing Python code in-browser. Some students liked to complete the homework and groups which allowed for easier debugging, but others preferred to work alone and go to Office Hours with any questions or issues.	Students generally found labs to be cool applications of the course material, but some did not find them very helpful for increasing understanding. There were two lab sessions per week, one with a focus on coding and the other with a more physical-based (usually robot-involving) application. Some labs were pretty long, and it could be frustrating to run out of time and have to come back during office hours for the checkoff. Many students did not like the timed aspect of labs, as it could be stressful at times.	6.01 has rigid grade cutoffs. Students generally found the grading to be pretty fair, but many thought the A cutoff was too high. Several students thought the nanoquizzes should be worth less.	There was no class textbook, but class notes were published online. A lot of students found the notes helpful, but could sometimes be lengthy and hard to understand.	There were weekly timed nanoquizzes given at the beginning of one the the lab sessions. Many students found these very stressful and thought they were weighted too heavily.

Interesting material\r\nHands on labs\r\nMRI material and machines	Disorganization\r\nLack of lecture notes	Students took this class to satisfy a core Course VI requirement.	Most students were able to complete the problem sets without too much trouble, but they didn't find them very helpful in getting a deeper understanding of the material. There was extensive use of MATLAB in many of the problem sets. Some students found collaboration helpful.	Many students found the labs interesting and useful for seeing the practical applications of classroom topics, but they didn't always help generate a higher understanding of the material. Students generally thought they were of reasonable length and looked forward to lab.	Students generally found the grading to be fair, with a reasonable balance between labs, problem sets, and exams. 	There was no textbook or lecture notes available, and students would have appreciated more resources. Many took to Googling or turned to third-party sites whenever they had questions about a concept.	Most problem sets were focused on MATLAB coding and the tests were more conceptual, so they could be difficult to prepare for. Some students found the quizzes to be fair, but most would have appreciated more practice exams to help with studying.	"Good material overall - I think using medical examples to teach signals stuff is neat."\r\n"Needs more direction"	Students generally enjoyed the course, but thought more organization would be helpful.

There was a focus on key issues in the design of engineered artifacts operating in the natural world: measuring and modeling system behaviors; assessing errors in sensors and effectors; specifying tasks; designing solutions based on analytical and computational models; planning, executing, and evaluating experimental tests of performance; and refining models and designs. The issues addressed were in the context of computer programs, control systems, probabilistic inference problems, circuits and transducers, which all play important roles in achieving robust operation of a large variety of engineered systems.	6.01 was a fast-paced class that covered a variety of topics to introduce students to electrical engineering and computer science. Theoretical topics covered during lectures were applied through the software and design labs, which was the bulk of the class. While the topics seemed fragmented, they were tied together by the physical robots the class used during design labs. To provide students with different methods for learning the material, 6.01 had lectures, problem sets, nanoquizzes, labs, and exams throughout the term. Topics ranged from circuits to object oriented programming. 	Labs\r\nRobots\r\nThe Staff	Exams and quizzes\r\nBroken hardware\r\nTimed labs\r\n	Not enough comments for summary.	Most students found problem sets useful for learning about the class material. Due to the difficulty and length of the problem sets, many students collaborated with each other to complete assignments but did not find bibles helpful or necessary. Some students did the problem sets on their own and found that to be more beneficial to their learning than collaborating or using a bible.	Most students thought that labs were useful for learning because they provided the opportunity to apply theoretical concepts learned in lecture to something concrete. The length of the labs were inconsistent -- some labs took longer than the allotted time while others were easier to complete. The longer labs felt tedious at times and students got stressed about completing the work in time. Students were also occasionally frustrated with lab equipment that broke down, but equipment was generally accessible.  Labs were also done with randomly assigned partners, which some students found frustrating and others found fun.  	The grading seemed to be fair. Letter cutoffs were around 90 for an A and 80 for a B. 	While there was no textbook for 6.01, there were notes available, which students found sufficient for the course. Students who used the notes generally used them for reference to complete assignments rather than for learning concepts. 	Weekly nanoquizzes were useful for keeping students up to date with the material. They were straightforward and very similar to the online tutor problems given. The exams were open book and encouraged thorough understanding of the material. Students felt that nanoquizzes and exams were generally fair. 	"can there be more supplies, especially for the larger classes because I sometimes couldn't finish a lab because I waited an hour for a robot and lab ended"\r\n"The labs are AWESOME! Real robots move like you tell them to .... most of the time."	Students suggested that documentation and explanation for some of the topics could be clearer. Having examples during lectures would have helped students learn concepts better as well. In terms of labs, some of the longer ones could have been made shorter so that students did not feel so stressed about the time crunch. Having more TA's and more working equipment would have helped students get through labs more quickly and easily. 		f	t	core	12	6	\N	\N	Not enough comments for summary.

Labs were incredibly useful and  most were reasonable in length, though a few had a greater time commitment. Labs often required Matlab coding, but students felt that they were walked through the steps too much. Despite that, students learned material well through the application of concepts in labs.	While a bit strict initially during the review of signal processing, the grading policy was widely seen as fair  and straightforward.	Students were strongly divided about the course notes: while some found them extremely useful and well organized, others found them far too technical and challenging to comprehend, given a lack of examples. While it was not required, students recommended using independent texts of signals and probability.	Two exams were given and cheat sheets were allowed.

Students thought grading was fair and lenient, although found nanoquizzes to be constructed in an unfair way. The average grade seemed to be fairly high.	There was no textbook, but the class did post annotated slides from each lecture and class notes to be reviewed before each lecture. The class notes were a helpful resource for the nanoquizzes. The class is taught in an "inverted classroom" style, where students are responsible for reviewing new content in the notes before a class and quizzed on it at the beginning of lecture. The following lecture then reviews the content.	There were no exams for the class, just nanoquizzes.

Most lectures are taught by guest lecturers so the class seemed like a seminar. There was a wealth of material and a lack of structure in the syllabus as a whole. The content was aimed at covering a broad range of topics rather than delving deep. Most students thought that the class was a good balance between theoretical and practical. 	Interesting content\r\nExposure to many fields	Time-consuming problem sets\r\nTextbook\r\nDisorganized guest lectures	Students took this course because it was an AUS and a 6-7 restricted elective.	Problem sets stimulated learning, but expectations unclear. Most students felt the problem sets were useful but took too long and were quite challenging. 	This class included a final project that focused on research.  Many students found the project difficult.  Considering the large workload of the problems sets, some students felt that too much was expected of them for the project. 	Students found that since the assignments were hard and that the graduate students in the class seemed to have more time to work on these, it was difficult to predict the grade distribution in advance. Students also found that grading was slow and it took a long time for assignments to be returned. 	Students found the textbook a poor source of information after the first chapter. Students were asked to make class notes and to use class notes from previous semesters as a resource.	There was one quiz in the class, which was difficult to prepare for because there was little review of past topics early in the semester. Students found that the breadth of the material was the most challenging aspect. Students thought that perhaps more time would have helped to allow more thinking for some problems. 	"Keeps you very busy, but covers great material in a comprehensible way."\r\n\r\n"Having different postdocs teaching the majority of the lectures made the flow of the class really choppy and I was not able to follow along well."	Most students thought that lectures should slow down and focus on small number of topics, covering them in depth. Moreover, students felt that more practical examples would benefit the students' learning. 	http://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/6/fa14/6.047/	f	f	BIO	12	\N	\N	\N	Not enough comments for a summary.

Build your own OS in lab\r\nFun and challenging material\r\nProfessor Kaashoek	Time-consuming labs\r\nDebugging\r\nCode reviews	Reputation, interest, requirements	The homework for this class consisted of reading questions for each lecture.  Students thought the questions were simple and interesting.  	Labs were the main part of the class.  There were five required labs.  All were challenging and time-consuming to complete.  Because bugs from one lab carry forward to future labs, each line of code had to be perfect, otherwise later debugging could become extremely difficult.  However, students agreed that the difficulty felt natural and they learned a lot from the experience.    	Grading consisted of two quizzes (30%); labs 1 through 5 (40%); home-work assignments, code reviews, and class participation (together 15%); and lab challenge problems and final project lab (together 15%).  All labs had to be completed to pass the course.  Students thought the grading was mostly straightforward and fair.  	There was no textbook.  All lecture notes, readings and reference material were on the class website.  	The two quizzes focused on specific details in the material.  Most students found them to be difficult.    	"I helped make an OS that can run ls and a web server. That just blows my mind."\r\n\r\n"The Labs are what makes this class both great and difficult. You will learn C the hard way, with each pointer mistake biting you in the ass."	Most students were happy with the class's current structure and workload.

Topics covered included directed and undirected graphical models, factor graphs and Gaussian models; hidden Markov models, linear dynamical systems.; sum‐product and junction tree algorithms; forward‐backward algorithm, Kalman filtering and smoothing; and min‐sum algorithm and Viterbi algorithm. Students felt that the heavily theoretical material was very useful for their research. The pace of the class was good in the first half of the semester, but became a bit too fast towards the second half. The class in general was very time consuming, so one should be cautious if they already have a heavy load for the semester.	Useful Material\r\nHelpful Class Notes	Long Problem Sets\r\nDifficult Exams\r\nFast Pace	\N	Problem sets were time consuming and generally difficult, but were very helpful for understanding the material. Most of the problem sets involved implementing the algorithms taught in lecture using MATLAB. Collaboration was very helpful for figuring out the problem sets.	None.	The class was graded fairly. In each problem set, only two problems, chosen at random, were actually graded. This was helpful, but it reduced the amount of feedback students recieved on their work.	There was no textbook for this class. Many students found the provided class notes to be very helpful, especially for solving the problem sets. The class notes were very thourough.	The exams were long and quite difficult, but were very relevant to the class material. Many felt that the exams were too heavily weighted, which added unnecessary stress to the class.	"This is a very important topic in engineering that can has a very wide application. Thus, students across all majors take this class to learn and utilize it in his/her research."\r\n\r\n"The class was so great and gave me several ideas for my research."\r\n\r\n"Thanks for an excellent class."	Students felt that the exams should not be graded as heavily. Also, the pacing of the second half of the course could be slowed down quite a bit.		f	f	AI	12	0	\N	\N	\N

Coverage of this class included basic circuit elements, MOSFETs, circuit abstraction, and amplifiers. These topics were given both a theoretical treatment (problem sets and exams) and a practical treatment (laboratory exercises). Overall, students found that the class was well taught, but complained that the course was poorly paced; on some occasions, multiple assignments were due on the same day. In addition, the course ramped up in difficulty as the semester progressed.	Demos\r\nProfessor Berggren\r\nWorking labs	MITx\r\nHeavy algebra on problem sets\r\nLab assignments	Students took this class to satisfy an EE foundation requirement.	Problem sets were long but many found them to be useful for learning the material. EdX was used heavily in the class which resulted in little to no feedback for students.	While labs were very time intensive, students felt they were both fun and helpful for learning material. Students recommended 6.169, the 3 unit extension, for those interested in gaining more lab experience.	The class was graded on an absolute cutoff, which many found fair.	While there was a required textbook, most students found lecture and recitation notes more useful.	There were two types of assessments, quizlets and exams.

Problem sets were worth 60% of the final course grade, and students found them long and tricky. Overall, they were very useful for learning the material, and many found talking to other students in the class about problems helpful for completing them. 	There was a final project that was worth 40% of the course grade. The options for this project were pre-selected by the professors, but students were unsure of how they were going to be assessed. Students appreciated being able to apply what they learned over the semester.	Grading was harsh due to the all or nothing grading on problem set assignments, but overall, students felt that it was fair. There was, however, very little feedback on the problem sets.	Students found the course notes to be the best resource in the class, followed by the free online textbook (Szeliski). As the semester progressed, course note quality began to drop, and the course material diverged from the textbook.	There were no exams in the class.

The project was done in groups, and students felt that a significant portion of the learning took place while working on the project. Overall, the project constituted more than half of the final course grade. 	Grading was not transparent, but part of the final project grade was scaled relative to the performance of the best final project in the class.	Students did not find the textbook  useful, but thought that the online lecture notes were sometimes useful, specifically if one attended lecture.	Exams were difficult but fair. Paying attention in lecture and doing the projects was good preparation. Old exams were released and were also helpful in studying for the exam.

The lectures presented the theory behind these techniques, and the assignments offered students a chance to implement the algorithms in a hands-on setting.  Some students commented that the exams were difficult, and the cutoff for an A grade was quite high.   Other students also commented that the class seemed to be geared toward undergraduates at times.	Engaging lectures\r\nInteresting projects	Harsh grading\r\nHeavy workload	Students took this course due to interest in its fascinating material and for the Grad-H credit. This course can be used in an Artificial Intelligence concentration within an MEng.	Students felt that the two problem sets and weekly optional exercises were interesting and helpful for learning the material, but were often difficult and time-consuming. The problem sets were more focused on coding and writing than the theory behind the topics.	Students enjoyed the open-ended final project and thought it was a good way to explore topics they were interested in, but some found it very time-consuming.	Students didn't like the strict 90% cutoff for an A, but felt that grades on individual assignments were generally fair.	Students found the lecture notes useful, but felt that they could have been better organized and contained a lot of errors. Many students also found the recommended textbooks useful for deepening their understanding.	Students generally thought the exams did a good job of testing their understanding, but some felt they were too long and difficult. Students found the optional exercises more helpful than the required problem sets when preparing for exams.	"There is a good blend of theory and practice."\r\n\r\n"Projects are really open so you have freedom to choose."	Students wanted more practical examples in lecture, and also felt that the grading policy should be re-evaluated with less emphasis on the exams.		f	f	AI	12	0	\N	\N	Not enough comments for summary.

Several students commented that the class's pace could be quite fast at times, and that problem sets had a tendency to heavily emphasize equations and formulas.	Teaching staff\r\nInteresting material	Design project	Students took this class to fulfill an EE header.	Students felt the problem sets were quite difficult, so collaboration was helpful.  The problems were described as largely "plug-and-chug" in nature, and students had differing opinions as to whether or not these problems helped reinforce knowledge or not.	The design project was very long and some parts were vague, but the TAs graded the projects reasonably. Some students felt it was fun and a great learning experience. 	Students felt the grading policy was clear and well thought out.	The textbook was useful and the class notes were excellent.	The exams covered the material well and were fair, but it was important to understand the material thoroughly as the exams could be somewhat long. 	"The design project can be time-intensive.

Applications of rule chaining, neural nets, genetic algorithms, and other learning/problem-solving paradigms are covered. Most students agreed that it introduced many key concepts for further study in AI, and that lectures were quite interesting and useful crafting an AI mindset in and of themselves, but relevant study material came more from recitations. While some application came from labs, students desired more practical implementations of the theory they covered.

In writing solutions, much of the code was given, so while the problems were useful for understanding the concepts and many students found them valuable in implementing algorithms taught, several wished for more challenging tasks.	Labs are the problem sets.	The grading policy is unusual, yet well-received: a second-chance policy. The final exam is divided into subsections which reflect the topics of previous exams. If students perform well on the previous exams, the final is not necessary. Otherwise, students need only complete those sections of the final exam to replace that mark in their final score. Overall, students loved it.	There were reference materials in the form of text excerpts and course notes, but while useful as supplements, most students relied solely on lectures and tutorials and performed well.	Students found quizzes very well-defined and straightforward tests of the material. The best preparation found was practicing previous years' exams, given large similarities in question topics and style. Students' split their assessments of the spiritual  (guest lecture) sections, with some finding them easy, and others having difficulty despite attending all lectures. The spiritual sections count for 2/7th of the final grade.		In general, the course style was widely applauded. The early time of the lectures and the ease of labs/problem sets were often noted as areas for improvement.	https://ai6034.mit.edu/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page	t	f	core	12	4	\N	\N	Not enough comments for a summary.

Many students collaborated and made liberal use of Piazza and office hours since initial insights into problems were the most difficult part. 	This course had no labs.	Overall, students found the policy fair.  Twenty percent of the final score is based upon recitation attendance/participation, with worst two recitations dropped. Similarly, the worst problem set score was dropped. No curving of scores takes place: final grades were dictated by predetermined score cutoffs, resulting in grades that were centered around a B. The policy was, with a few exceptions, well-received.	Most students found the textbook and class notes quite thorough and in step with the lectures, covering all the material necessary in the class. The textbook was free of charge.  Many students referred to it as "The Bible".	Reflecting on the one midterm given, many students found it fair, and even pleasant, given the double-sided crib sheet allowed. The midterm was found significantly easier than the preceding problem sets, though given the incongruity, students would have preferred more practice material.	"I feel that the quantitative reasoning skills and intuition I gained in 6.042 will be incredibly useful to have in real life."\r\n\r\n"As someone who did competition math in high school, much of this class was review"\r\n	Students were mixed on the lecture, with most finding the format good and engaging, while some others desired more accessibility with the material.

Topics covered include  greedy algorithms, amortized analysis, network flow, caching, and parallel computing. While most students were enthused by the subject matter being taught, after 6.006, they found this course tried to cover too much too quickly, with a piecemeal organizational system for topics.

While problem statements were often long, most students found them very helpful towards learning and understanding the material.	There were no labs in this course.	While some students expressed confusion as to the grading policy and cutoffs, most found that the grades were distributed fairly with a curve on exams. While some found problem set grading straightforward, others found it subjective with similar errors being weighted differently depending on the grader.	The textbook for this class, CLRS, was dry but very helpful as expected. Students had differing opinions on class notes: some found it helpful by distilling information, and others criticized the lack of uniformity and consistency between notes on different subjects.	The first (in-class) exam was reasonably difficult though and was a bit too long for the time allotted possibly contributing to the low average. The second (take-home) exam/final is time-consuming, though most students enjoyed the extra time, considering it a long set with a few days to complete. Overall, the problems focused less on the straightforward use of the algorithms presented in class and more on the development and modification of less familiar algorithms.	"Instead of trying to squeeze in so much different concepts and ideas, I feel it's better to limit to fewer more important ones and give very rigorous explanation."\r\n\r\n"I definitely learned a lot and became a better problem solver as a result of being forced to think about hard problems all semester."\r\n\r\n	Students suggested removing the attendance requirement and focusing on techniques as opposed to the results of the techniques.

Lectures covered design methods and problem-solving strategies, institutional review boards, human factors, human-machine interfaces, community perspectives, social and ethical aspects, and assistive technology for motor, cognitive, perceptual, and age-related impairments. Students worked in groups with real clients in order to create a project to assist with their disability. Many found working with these clients to be interesting, eye-opening, and very rewarding. Some students felt that the class could have benefited from stricter milestone deadlines, as to keep projects progressing at a steady pace.	Real world experience\r\nMaking an impact\r\nOpen-ended project	Time consuming\r\nLack of steady deadlines	Students joined this course due to its AUS status and its reputation of working on real-world problems.	Rather than giving problem sets, this class had writing assignments, most of which made students think about issues regarding disability. The remaining assignments were for project documentation.	Monday labs acquainted students with different types of assistive technologies. Wednesday labs allowed students to check in with their mentors and provide progress updates.	The grading policy for the class was clear and fair. Students who worked hard and put effort into their projects did very well.	There was an optional textbook, although many students felt that it was unnecessary. Since the class was very hands-on, there was little need for note-taking.

Information on grade cutoffs was not provided. 	The textbook was "Introduction to Algorithms" by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, Stein. The extent of the textbook's usefulness is debatable, but students generally found it helpful to at least some degree. There were also class notes posted that students tended to find useful.	The exams were difficult, though students found them fair for the most part. Not only did they require thorough understanding of lecture material, but also strong math backgrounds. Creativity, in the sense of thinking about which algorithms to use for various problems, was essential. Time was an issue for most students and thus managing the time wisely was recommended. 	"This class is too hard"	The material was difficult, thus spending more time on certain topics  rather than trying to tackle a broad range of topics may be better in facilitating a better understanding. Weekly problem sets were also troublesome due to the difficulty and thus, non-weekly problem sets may be better.

Students worked in groups of three to develop a system designed to solve a real-world problem. Most found it a good reinforcement of the material, and agreed that it was smart to start early on the project. Some felt that under-specification better represented the real world, while others would have appreciated more specification.	Except for the exams and design project, grading was done on a check/check-/check+ system. Students felt that this system was rather unclear at times, and that they would have appreciated more feedback. They also felt that there was a bit of variation between recitation instructors.	Most students found the lecture notes quite useful, more so than the textbook which they found verbose. Students appreciated the papers assigned, especially the relevance of the material to real world systems.	There were two open-laptop quizzes, one during the term and one during finals week. Students found the first exam rather long. Most felt that the multiple choice format made it harder to obtain partial credit and that the quizzes focused too much on the details of the assigned papers, though some felt that it was fair because of the open-note format.

There was a good balance between application and theory. 	Robots\nPython\nClass material	Debugging\nBroken lab equipment\n	Students took this class because they wanted to check out the introductory class in the new Course VI curriculum. Some took it because it had hands-on lab time and it was a great class that combined theory and application.	The problem sets were pretty short and typically taught students what they needed to learn. They were useful in learning the material.	The labs were an integral part of the class. They were helpful in solidifying the material covered in lectures. Sometimes they were long and sometimes they were short, but overall very reasonable.	The grading policy was fair overall although the check/+/- grading policy was somewhat vague. \n	The class notes and online notes were well-written and helpful in learning the material.

This course covers various machine learning algorithms such as generalization, clustering, classification, support vector machines, hidden Markov models, and Bayesian networks with an emphasis on model formulation and applications. The interesting material had many cool applications that were partly shown in projects, and the work was not too hard. The lecturers could have done a better job of teaching the algorithms in depth with less complex math.	Material\nApplications\nProjects	Delay in posting notes\nLong early lectures\nVague projects	This class satisfied the AUS or 6.034 requirement. The material was interesting and applicable.	The problem sets were useful and generally not hard, but students felt the use of MIT edX took away from learning because infinite checks were available. The problems could have gone deeper into the material with less mathematical computations.	Students appreciated that the three projects were interesting and showed real-world applications of the material. However, the instructions could have been clearer and let the students explore more on their own.	The grading policy generally seemed fair but could have been more transparent. Most grades in the class were high, so students did not know what to expect. The general policy was that the top 25% of the class would receive A's, and B's would be rewarded to those with average grades.	The course relied on class notes that were helpful and organized, but a little dense. Students wished that the notes were posted on time but also understood that this was the first time the class was offered.	The straightforward and fair midterm focused on testing machine learning concepts. Most students did very well.	"SO INTERESTING"\n"We could actually use MORE homework."

Students often found that they needed help from others to debug the coding portions.	The course had software and design labs. Labs were in general interesting, though students didn't find them particularly useful towards exams (unless a question about a specific lab was asked). The labs provided some experience with good engineering practices. Students found that the time constraints were hard to meet and they had to go in during office hours to finish up the labs.	The grading of the material itself was fair, but the grading policy is fixed with strict cutoffs that students believe could be lowered as exam averages were relatively low. Students found the late policy fair.	There was no textbook, but online course notes were available. Students found the online course notes only somewhat helpful. Online videos were also present, which students found useful.	While some students found exams to be fair assessments of their understanding of the material, most students found them difficult and hard to prepare for. The quizzes lacked opportunities for students to receive partial credit. The class also had weekly nanoquizzes that were easy if students were keeping up with the work in the class (e.g. doing problem sets early); otherwise they were difficult.

Problems sets included two parts: Part A with theoretical questions and Part B with coding questions. Overall students felt that solving problems greatly contributed to their learning and reinforced concepts from the lectures. The coding question was autograded, which students sometimes found confusing due to the lack of the detailed feedback from the server. Students indicated that problem sets were generally time consuming and quite difficult, but they were given enough time (2 weeks) to complete them.	There were no labs in this course.	Students felt that overall grading was relatively fair, with somewhat high breakpoints. Exam grading was said to be more harsh than problem sets grading. Students felt that the grading scheme was not transparent and they did not know the cut-offs.	Some of the students thought the textbook was useful, but went more in depth than the course material. Other students preferred lecture and recitations notes as a helpful reference.	There were two quizzes in this class. Students found them to be difficult, but appropriately testing the thorough understanding of the concepts and material rather than memorization.

It was suitable for students interested in transforming an idea into a business or other realization for wide-scale societal impact. Students learned about entrepreneurship through a diverse set of guest lectures, small writing assignments, and team projects. The emphasis was on personal skills and practical experiences. Students thought the guest lecturers were engaging and informative, but the assignments did not contribute much to their learning. 	Guest speakers\r\nEasy workload	Specific nanoquizzes\r\nNight classes	Students took this course to learn more about entrepreneurship.	Assignments included two pages of writing per week, which often focused on meeting the length requirement rather than high quality work.

There were no labs for this class.	Students had mixed opinions about the grading: some students felt that it was fair, while others believed that the grading was harsh. They indicated that problem set grading was quite strict and that staff members did not provide much feedback.	Some of the students found the textbook to be helpful, even though it did not cover all the topics and material presented in lectures.	Many students thought that the quizzes were fair and of a reasonable difficulty level.

It covers human capabilities, design principles, prototyping techniques, evaluation techniques, and the implementation of graphical user interfaces, each applied in short programming exercises and a semester-long project. Students generally enjoyed the course material and the opportunity to apply theoretical concepts on the assignments and the project, but were dissatisfied with the nanoquizzes, lack of the standardized grading scheme and constraints on the choice of web-tools.	Interesting and useful material\r\nGroup project\r\nLecturers	Nanoquizzes\r\nGrading\r\nWiki write-ups	This class fulfilled an AUS or Department Lab requirement.	The class assignments included 3 problem sets and 2 homework write-ups. Students found that problem sets had a reasonable level of difficulty and helped them to recap/learn web-programming skills (HTML/CSS/Javascript) which were not taught in class. 	One of the main assignments was a semester-long group project. Students felt it was quite time-consuming, but well-defined milestones and checkpoints helped to distribute workload more evenly. Students particularly enjoyed the chance to design an application from scratch and improve it during the entire semester, finding it a good introduction to the iterative design cycle.	Students found the overall grading to be generally fair, but the grading of the final project was subjective and dependent on the TA. The course average was fairly high.	There was no required textbook for the class, but students were assigned mandatory pre-lecture readings (class notes). Nanoquizzes tested the knowledge based on the class notes. While most of the students enjoyed the content of the notes, some of them found that the lecture material and the readings were somewhat repetitive.	There were no midterms for this class. Students were given daily nanoquizzes on the class notes material. Some students indicated that careful and thorough reading of the class notes would help to succeed in the nanoquizzes, even though the wording of the questions was sometimes confusing. The lowest 5 grades were dropped.	"It was a great class. The assignments were fun and do-able."\r\n\r\n"I thoroughly enjoyed Prof Millers lectures.

Many students also wanted to learn more about software construction techniques and to gain more practical programming experience.	Problem sets were extremely long and time consuming, but also very helpful and educational. Students thought that office hours and Piazza were valuable. 	Students thought the final team project was fun and a good cumulative application of knowledge learned throughout the semester. It was useful to experience working with a team on a coding project. Some students disliked how much time the project took at the end of the semester.	Students thought grading was clear and fair. Some students thought that setting the hard cutoff for an A at 90% was wrong.	There was no textbook for this class. Students thought that the daily readings offered on the class website were well-organized and helpful reference material.	There were two quizzes, which some students thought were a bit tricky. Students effectively prepared for the quizzes by doing the readings and practicing past quizzes. Students generally thought the daily nanoquizzes were annoying.	"I definitely feel like it took up a majority of my time. Requires a lot of out-of-class work and time in office hours to get help on each pset. However, I learned more than I have in any other class, and I feel like this is a vital class for any course 6 major."\r\n"I learned SO MUCH about Java and coding in general, that with this class alone I'm ready to tackle new projects."

Students enjoyed putting theory to practice as they implemented the algorithms in the three labs, but were discontent with the poor administration of the course. The course gave students a very broad and initial understanding of general machine learning concepts through a mix of theoretical and hands-on methods.	Broad applications of the material\r\nStimulating theoretical material\r\nProjects that allowed students to apply theory	Poor administration\r\nDifficulty communicating with staff\r\nProject codes were not thoroughly checked for bugs before their release	The class served as either an AUS or a CS header replacement for 6.034.	Problem sets were only worth 10% of the grade and were graded based on effort (sufficient effort received a 1, otherwise the problem set received a 0). As a result, some students did not put their all in attempting the problem sets and did not believe that the grading scheme allowed for feedback on their work. Students found the problem sets relatively short and while some found them useful, others believed that they were not always aligned with what the lectures covered.	Generally, students found the material of the labs interesting. Students' main concern was the quality of the skeleton code given to them as there were frequent bugs that they spent time trying to debug. This resulted in the staff releasing updated versions of the code as bugs were found and fixed. 	The students' general consensus on grading was that it lacked transparency and thus students had a hard time commenting on the grading. 	There was no textbook for this class, but most of the students found the lecture notes quite useful in getting the points across. Some students wished that the lecture notes were posted faster than they were while others wished that a textbook was also provided.	The class had one midterm, which most students found straightforward and relatively fair, though there were students who found it difficult. Students wished that there were more practice tests to study. In addition, students pointed out that the midterm focused on subtleties of the material at times (specifically in the True/False section).	"Really cool algorithms. Really cool applications. Interesting theoretical content."\r\n\r\n"Good overview of machine learning. You see a little of many things."	Students suggested that the teaching staff improve on administration. In terms of material, students would've liked to see more intuition behind the algorithms and how the various concepts presented in class connected with each other.	http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.036/spring_2015/info.html	t	f	\N	12	0	\N	\N	\N

Interesting EE and applied material\r\nCool applications\r\nExciting labs	Problem sets \r\nCourse organization\r\nLack of depth	Most students took this class because it is a Course 6-1 foundation.	Most students found that office hours  and collaboration were particularly helpful in completing the problem sets.	Students generally found the labs to be interesting, reasonable, and helpful in understanding the subject material.	Students agreed that the grading policy was fair in all categories (problem sets, labs, and tests).	There were recommended textbooks, but students found course notes and lecture notes to be much more relevant to the coursework.	Opinions varied regarding the difficulty of the quizzes, but most students agreed that the quizzes reflected the problem sets rather well.	"This class will really push the engineering of machines to harness EM energy, but does not get bogged down on extensive derivations or complex calculations; trust your intuition."\r\n"This class felt a bit more like a survey class in course 8 rather than one in course 6.

There were no problem sets for this class.	Students found the labs to be quite interesting overall, but they had mixed feelings about their overall relevance to the course material.  Feelings were also mixed about the TA's and LA's.  Some students found their feedback on labs useful, but other students felt that the wait was sometimes too long, as they seemed occasionally understaffed, and there were even times when they did not show up when they were supposed to.	While some felt that the grading on quizzes was a little bit harsh at times, overall, they found the grading for class to be fair and transparent.  They especially appreciated the fact that grade boundaries and point distributions for each assignment and quiz were clearly laid out at the beginning of the semester, making it easy for them to keep track of their progress.	There is no official textbook for the class.  There is a set of class notes online, but they are in a work progress.  Furthermore, the available chapters do not cover the entire course.  Lecture handouts, which are printouts of the lecture PowerPoint slides, are available both online and in lecture.  Lectures are recorded and posted online, and most students found that resource particularly useful.	There were four quizzes for this class.  Overall, students thought they were fair and well representative of the material taught.  In addition to lecture notes and recitations, many found that studying past quizzes and reviewing the tutorial problems posted online were useful in doing well on the quizzes.	"The grading was very fair for the most part and was laid out at the beginning of the semester.  The site always had the point values laid out and how much each assignment was so that you were never unsure of grades.  Each assignment was very completable from what we learned in lecture and the instructions [...] past quizzes gave a good idea of what each quiz will be like."\r\n"The online videos were very helpful, especially the videos of Professor Terman going over quiz problems in double speed.

It involved many long problem sets in Java, a final project and quizzes. There were also in class quizzes to check for attendance and understanding. The class is very hands-on and students felt they grew a lot as software engineers over the course of the semester.	Interesting labs\r\nOrganized lectures\r\nRob Miller and Max Goldman	Nanoquizzes\r\nWriting specs\r\nDebugging	Students took this course because it is a CS foundational class and to learn how software is built in teams.	Problem sets were primarily software assignments. After initial solutions were submitted, peers reviewed the solutions, and time was provided to make corrections. Students found them challenging and useful in learning the material, but very time-consuming.	While there were no specific labs, there was a group design project at the end of the course which students found difficult but useful in learning how to coordinate building large software projects in teams.	While most students felt the grading policy was clear and fair, some students felt parts of the grading scheme were subjective with regard to code quality causing ambiguity.	Class readings and notes were provided online, with questions and nanoquizzes often. The readings were a bit long, but thorough and useful at understanding broader engineering concepts.	Two types of assessments were used in this class: exams and nanoquizzes. Nanoquizzes were based on readings, occurred periodically, and focused on the most recent subject covered.

Methods taught include active learning, boosting, support vector machines, non-parametric Bayesian methods, hidden Markov models, and Bayesian networks. The class is almost entirely theoretical, with some practical application being introduced in the project.	Great coverage of machine learning topics\r\nAmazing grading and Piazza response speed 	Dry and tedious math\r\nWriting conference-style reports for problem sets	Students took this course because it contributed to an Artificial Intelligence  MEng concentration and was a TQE.	Homeworks were interesting exercises in learning to implement and apply methods from class. The homework writeups were long and tedious and took away from the learning process. Students thought it was unnecessary to generate graphs and tables just to convince the reviewer to give them a good grade, when the already knew what they were doing was correct. The homeworks were in general more practical and hands-on than the rest of the class.	This course had no labs.	The grading for 6.867 was fair in general. The two exams were weighted at 25% each, the three problem sets were weighted at 25% total, and the final project was worth another 25%. It was not too difficult to get a perfect score on the projects and exams if the person put in enough effort. The exams were very challenging though and difficult to do well on. 	The class notes were very helpful that helped students really understand the material. The notes did not go as much into depth as the textbook however. The textbook was extremely useful. Instructors could occasionally move too fast on certain explanations, and the book provided a nice support to understand what was taught in class. 	The exams were much more theoretical than the problem states which made them extremely hard to study for. The exams tested knowledge of the machine learning material, and students could not simply do well by regurgitating examples of problems done in lecture or recitation. The exams tested a good range of topics in the course.	Assignments were really beneficial and hands on. \r\n\r\n No bible, and it was cool to code up the algorithms. It was a bit tedious to write up the answers into a latex-ed conference style paper. 	The graphical models took up way too much time for the course curriculum and there was not sufficient motivation for these models to be included as part of a machine learning course. More practice exams should have been provided to students for them to better prepare for the midterm and final exam. The course should have placed a greater emphasis on the projects and applications of machine learning instead of focusing the content on theoretical math. Lectures should have also been scheduled in the afternoon.		f	f	AI	12	\N	\N	\N	Not enough comments

The course moved quickly and was very difficult. Many students felt that the class was a collection of disconnected topics and that several of the topics were not taught well. A number of students thought that insufficient office hours were provided to help students with the material. 	Learning advanced algorithms rigorously\r\nProf. Shavit	Very difficult\r\nPoor lecture notes\r\nTake-home test	This class satisfied a header requirement for Course 6-3.	Problem sets were of a reasonable length and thought to be extremely important for learning the material. Students found collaboration and attending office hours very helpful for completing the problem sets.	There were no labs in this class.	The grading distribution was unknown. Exams were graded harshly and averages were quite low. Students seemed to be split on the quality of grading--some thought it was fair, while others felt their solutions were being skimmed by graders for similarity to a sample solution, rather than being graded carefully. 	The textbook was CLRS, which is the classic text for algorithms. Students found the textbook to be useful. Course notes were also provided, but students found them to be disorganized and sometimes difficult to understand.	The exams were very difficult and required a lot of preparation to do well. The questions on the tests were much more difficult than the ones on the problem sets. The take-home test was thought to be incredibly stressful, though some students preferred that it was not time-constrained unlike the in-class exam.		\N		t	f	core	12	\N	\N	\N	\N

The material is taught substantially through labs that involve programming robots. Experiences with the class substantially varied among students depending on the student's prior knowledge and interests. The material was very broad and was a mixture of theoretical concepts and hands-on labs.	Working with robots\r\nHands-on learning\r\nIntegration of EE and CS material	Time-pressured labs\r\nStrict grade cutoffs\r\nDifficult exams	This class is required of all Course VI majors.	The problem sets were very useful for learning the material. However, they were long and students felt they could be tedious and repetitive. The problems tended to much easier and also not very similar to the problems given on exams.	Students enjoyed the labs and thought they were useful for learning the material. The TAs and LAs were generally very helpful when students got stuck on the labs. However, they would benefit by being shortened, as students found it difficult to complete them in the allotted time.	Students mostly thought the grading was fair. Letter grades were assigned on a strict cutoff, which many thought was too harsh given the low averages on the exams. 	Students found the class notes to be well-written and very helpful, although some students found them to be very dense and occasionally difficult to follow. There was no textbook for the class. A few students also recommended watching the mini-lecture videos available online.\r\n\r\n	Exams were very difficult, focusing on critical thinking and requiring a deep conceptual understanding of the material. The averages on the second exam were particularly low, which was frustrating because the exam was not curved and the class operated on strict grade cutoffs. The exam problems were much harder than anything seen in the problem sets or labs. Students were unsure how to prepare for the exams, and some felt that prior knowledge in addition to great problem solving skills were key to doing well on them.\r\n\r\nThe class also had weekly nanoquizzes, which were thought to be straightforward and similar to the problem sets.		\N		f	t	core	12	6	\N	\N	\N

The problem sets were generally thought of in a positive light and consist of theoretical and coding parts. Some students felt that problem sets should be shorter with more frequent ones, while others would have preferred them not to fall on the same weeks as the exams. They generally built up from easy to harder problems over the course of the problem set.\r\n\r\nIn general, students felt that there should be more office hours as they tended to get full quickly and it would be hard to get your question answered. The exams were shortened this semester and were 50 mins long, which students found to be difficult. The class was thought to be well organized, with lecture content being uploaded online and Piazza questions answered promptly which let students focus on learning information in the class.\r\n\r\nStudents felt that the pace of the course was really good for most students, but definitely had a time that it was stagnant as the same concept was covered for more than a week at a time.\r\n\r\nStudents felt that the grading was not transparent enough, with some students feeling there were too strict grade cutoffs.	Helpful for technical interviews\r\nCool concepts and material\r\nChallenging but rewarding problem sets	Difficult 1-hour exams\r\nPoor office hour availability\r\nSlow online queue for code feedback	Students took this class to satisfy a CS foundation requirement.	Problem sets were generally thought to be helpful in learning. Many students found that collaborating was essential for them as well as going to office hours. Students felt that they can be time consuming if done by themselves. Problem sets contained a combination of algorithm design and implementation with Python coding examples.	None	Students were in the middle of the grading policy. Many students thought it was fair that 35% got A's, 40% B's etc but some felt that it wasn't fair to have such strict cutoffs. Grading was thought to be subjective at times, dependent on a TA to TA basis.	Some students felt that the textbook is unnecessary, while others swear by it. The class and recitation notes are very thorough and seem to suffice for most students.	The exams were too short and hard for many students, as they felt that 50 minutes was not enough time to be able to accurately perform on the exams. Note sheets were allowed on the exams but were not always helpful as questions required fast thinking and wit.	"I really enjoyed the psets for 6.006. I thought that they did an excellent job of helping me understand the material, and most of my learning happened when I worked with my pset group. We discovered a lot about the algorithms from class by testing different things and seeing if they gave the desired run time, which helped me learn a lot."\r\n\r\n"I love this class, and I'm not necessarily getting an A in it."\r\n	Students would have felt better with better exam and problem set scheduling, along with more accurate tips on how to prepare for tests and final.	http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.006/	f	f	core	12	0	\N	\N	\N

Students enjoyed the material and the hands-on labs. Across the board, students had difficulty with the signals portion of the class, which might have been better if the class had slowed down in that section. Some of the problem sets were frustrating; in particular, students recommended removing the use of the Audiocomm package from the class.

The course is theory-oriented with some opportunities for practical experience.	Labs\r\nProfessor Berggren\r\nConsistent workload	Exams\r\nLengthy and confusing problem sets\r\n	Students took this class to satisfy an EE foundation requirement.\r\n\r\n	Problem sets covered the appropriate material, but students found collaboration and office hours were necessary because problems were often left room for interpretation. While some students thought the problem sets were good at gauging understanding, others found them tedious.	Four studio labs were offered in the semester, giving students the chance to get experience with circuit debugging and analysis tools. Though some students found the labs difficult to accomplish without assistance, many found them relevant to the lectures and fun.	Most students found the grading policy, which included hard cutoffs, to be fair. Online grades were regularly updated, providing consistent feedback to students on their overall performance.	The textbook was provided online and was often useful for providing greater depth to lectures since no class notes were given. Some students found they did not need the textbook throughout the course.	Two types of assessments were given: biweekly quizlets and exams. Quizlets were given to encourage attendance and provide periodic feedback on the material. Exams were more comprehensive and less frequent. Both were found reasonable with problems of similar difficulty to problem set questions.		\N		f	f	core	12	\N	\N	\N	\N

Fundamental concepts in computational biology were not really taught. A significant amount of background knowledge in biology and programming was needed. Many lectures were guest lectures introducing current hot topics in the field. Problem sets were a huge part of the course and were time-consuming. Students claimed the term project also required a lot of time and effort and recommended to start the project early. The pace of the class was very fast and covered a lot of material. 	Breadth of field\r\nProfessor Kellis' enthusiasm\r\nProjects\r\n	Little guidance on the fundamentals. Dense lectures\r\nTime-consuming assignments	Students took this course because it contributed toward a BioEECS MEng concentration.	Problem sets were typically long and hard and usually asked students to implement algorithms or analyze data. They were progressively more difficult and students felt they needed to start early and go to office hours to finish them.  	The semester long project, worth 40% of the total grade, asked students to develop a novel project on their own and find a mentor to guide them throughout. The project was overwhelming for undergraduates not completely comfortable with the field and required a lot of work. 	No pset comments or solutions were provided and grading was slow. Score histograms for the class were provided for each pset and the quiz though no expected distributions or grade cutoffs were provided. 	Though thorough class notes were provided, not all students found them helpful.	One cumulative quiz was given near the end of the course worth 20% of the grade. Most students felt the quiz required a lot of studying since it covered a lot of material and fell on the harder side of spectrum. 		The general consensus was that this class was a LOT of work, especially for undergraduates, including problem sets, a quiz, and semester long project. Students suggested that  the class leaves more time to work on the project near the end of the term with less problem sets due as the problem sets were difficult and took time away from working on the project. 		f	f	\N	12	0	\N	\N	\N

Students found the class to be difficult, but also one of the most rewarding classes they've taken in Course VI. The class was fast paced as it had exams, problem sets and projects combined over the course of the semester. Some students felt that the grading was not very clear on the projects and that it came to be too intense since there were weeks where there were problem sets, an exam and a project due at the same time.	Cool projects\r\nInteresting guest lecturers\r\n	Poor class organization/communication\r\nVery fast paced\r\nLot of work	Students took this course because it was a CS Lab and an AUS. Students were also drawn by the impressive class reputation of how much you can learn over the course of the class, despite it's intensity.	Students felt that the problem sets were useful and collaboration helped on them. They felt that they were not too difficult and helped in reinforcing class concepts. Students had a general consensus that they were pretty fair overall.	Students felt that the projects were really cool and fun but also required a large amount of time. They had very good topics covered but became very stressful in terms of grading. The projects also pitted student projects against each other which was stressful.	Students felt that overall, grading seemed as fair as it could get but still found the class pretty tough. They felt that if the class was easier, it would take away from the quality of the class. Students generally found the class difficult and that the class was designed to be the way it was - grading projects on a curve which was based off of how everyone else does to determine cutoffs.	Students felt that were no textbook or class notes but felt that the slides were sufficient and it was important to going to lecture. Some students wished that a textbook or more class notes existed.	Students felt that the exams were difficult as there was limited study material and seemed to be more like trivia. They were multiple choice which resulted in difficulties in being able to get partial credit / vagueness in the way performance is defined in the system. However, many students felt that the quizzes were reasonable as they expected a solid understanding of the class material.	"Tons of work, but you get a lot out of it if you try."\r\n\r\n"SUPER MEGA FAST PROGRAMMING. Cool projects, very interesting material, you feel like a pro at the end."	Students would have liked to have work more spread out over the course of the semester instead of it being clumped so much together. Students would also have appreciated more class notes or a textbook of sorts and try to see if there are other ways to incorporate exams into the class.		f	t	\N	18	\N	\N	\N	\N

Problem sets were relatively short but difficult. The questions thoroughly covered the material. Most students found them a fair challenge and collaborated during office hours to complete them. 	The course contained a final design project which students found very difficult but rewarding in terms of tying together earlier concepts. Because the objectives could be somewhat vague and the SPICE tool was unfamiliar, students spent significant amounts of time working on it.	Many students expressed confusion about the grading policy and final grade cutoffs, though several complimented the quick online grade updates for individual assignments.	The textbook was very useful at supplementing lectures and providing greater depth and detail into the subject matter than covered in the course. 	Exams were significantly more difficult than problem sets, though both covered the same material. Students were permitted to reference notes and the book during the exam.		\N		t	f	\N	12	\N	\N	\N	\N

Probabilistic graphical models\r\nProfessor Wornell\r\nResearch potential	Debugging Matlab\r\nAbstract theory\r\n	Students took this course because it contributed to three MEng concentrations: Artificial Intelligence, Communications, and Signals and Systems.	Problem sets were very challenging, prompting many students to collaborate. Students found the problems were useful as practice for exams.	Although there were no labs in this course, there was a final design project. Students found the project excessively long, specifically because  large amounts of debugging were necessary on Matlab code. Many students seeing the difference between the heavy theory of the course and its potential applications.	Not enough comments for summary.	No textbook was recommended for this course in part due to the subject matter being an active area of research. Class notes were provided and found useful, but the notes were often posted with a noticeable delay from the lecture in which they were presented.	The exams were challenging, but well-organized and well-written. Exam problems did required deep thought and a thorough mastery of the material.		\N		f	f	\N	12	\N	\N	\N	\N

Topics included harmonic oscillator quantization, number and coherent states, quantum cryptography, and quantum teleportation. Most lectures in this course were highly theoretical, with material being covered quickly.	Quantum entanglement lab\r\nProfessor Shapiro	Lengthy calculations\r\nDifficult concepts	Students took this course because it contributes to a Communications MEng concentration.	Problem sets were very useful at learning the material and providing insight into the theory presented in lecture. Students did feel that though problems led to interesting practical results, the majority of time spent on the problems went on exclusively working on the mathematical derivations and not on the broader contexts of each problem.	This course contained no labs, but lab tours and demos were provided at the end of the course to demonstrate how quantum optical communication research is conducted.	Not enough comments for summary.	No textbook was assigned for this course, but students acclaimed the lecture notes provided.

Specific theoretical subjects like reinforcement learning are covered in theory, while examples from biological systems and underwater robotics are used to motivate the material. While the lectures discuss many practical issues, it is simulation-based course.	Robots\r\nAdvanced control techniques\r\nWell-motivated examples	Grading of MITx problem sets\r\nLarge project writeup\r\nIncomplete textbook	Students took this course because it contributed to an Artificial Intelligence MEng concentration and out of a passion for building robots.	Problem sets were assigned via MITx and varied in difficulty with a mix of theoretical questions and implementation of algorithms in Matlab. Collaboration was necessary prior to online submission of answers due to the strict grading policy for the problems.	A final project capped off the course, allowing students to practically apply the material. While students enjoyed completing the project, several found the timeline to complete it too short considering that few students had prior experience in the requisite Drake software framework.	Students found the grading policy generous overall. Assignment-wise, many were annoyed by the fact that there were no extra chances allowed on online problem sets. Certain questions were awarded all or no points purely on the accuracy of the submitted answer.	A free textbook was provided in the course as an online living document. As such, though students found it an excellent resource to review the basics, some sections were incomplete.	One exam was given during the term which students found a difficult but fair assessment of students' understanding of the material.	Watching something cool work and then studying how to derive it and come to new conclusions is extremely satisfying and inspiring.	\N		f	f	\N	12	\N	\N	\N	\N

Specific topics covered included transport protocols, routing within the internet, and peer-to-peer networks. The course analyzes networking research papers making the material and lectures primarily theoretical. Students can apply the material practically in the semester-long final project.	Professor Katabi\r\nInteresting networking papers\r\nTechnologies used in the final project	Significant focus on wireless networks\r\nPoor staff communication\r\nAssumptions of prior knowledge	Students took this course because it contributed to a Computer Systems MEng concentration.	Problem sets were very theoretical, and students considered the length and difficulty of the assignments reasonable. The questions on the problem sets mapped well to future exam problems.	This course had a single lab as a subset of one of the problem sets, and most students found it straightforward provided earlier parts of the problem set were completed. The final project for the course required original wireless research which many students found daunting and somewhat unreasonable but interesting nonetheless.	The grading distribution was unclear in large part because most assignments suffered long delays before being graded.	There was no textbook, but for each lecture, a student was assigned to scribe lecture notes. The notes were then shared to the class. Contingent on the current student's note taking abilities, many students found the system helpful in learning the material.	A single exam was given during the course which many students considered long and difficult, prompting extra time to be provided to the class at large. In order to prepare, students found it necessary to understand the papers well and do many practice problems from previous exams.		\N		f	f	\N	12	\N	\N	\N	\N

Database schema and design, query processing and optimization, and database recovery were all topics covered. The course was a good mix of theory and practice given that lectures offered insight into the theoretical architecture and labs offered insight into the practical implementation of such systems.	Lectures\r\nPoster presentations\r\nProfessor Madden\r\nLabs	No assignment feedback until drop date\r\nLabs	Students took this course because it contributed to a Computer Systems MEng concentration.	Problem sets were very useful in learning the material, but they often required much time to complete due to length and difficulty. Collaboration was deemed necessary by most students.	The labs were useful in understanding the internals of a simple relational database system but less useful in learning the high-level material covered in lecture. The codebase often contained bugs which were discovered after the assignment had already been released, prompting annoyance in most students. Due to the bugs in and the general difficulty of the assignments, students spent a substantial amount of time completing them.	Grading distribution is fair, but nearly all assignments suffered huge delays before being graded and returned. With such delayed feedback, most students were unsure of their actual performance in the course.	Most readings were original research papers, though a textbook was recommended. Posted class notes were more of an outline of each lecture rather than a structured set of concepts and examples. Therefore, students wished that they could access the notes in advance to guide note-taking during the lecture.	Exams reflected the covered material but in greater depth than problem set questions or lectures covered. While notes and textbooks were allowed during the exam, many students found the best preparation came from previous exams.		\N		f	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N

Students felt that the course provided a good balance of theoretical background and practical application of the material. The class included four homework assignments, a midterm, and a final project.	Interesting material directly related to cutting-edge research\r\nProf. Barzilay and Prof. Jaakola	Slightly disorganized\r\nNo textbook\r\nUnevenly distributed workload\r\nDifficult midterm exam	Students took this course as an AI AUS class.	Students felt the four problem sets were of reasonable difficulty. Problem sets were fairly practical and helped to solidify understanding and demonstrate the relevance of the material from lectures. Many students found collaboration useful.	Students felt the open-ended final project was somewhat intimidating, but provided a good opportunity to apply the material learned in the class. Students appreciated the availability of the course staff to help with the project.	Students felt the grading was generally fair. Grades were decided as follows: 20% problem sets, 30% midterm exam, 50% final project.	Course notes were taken by students for extra credit, so course notes were not always available and there was often a delay before the lecture notes were posted. However, the course notes were very detailed when available. There was no textbook for the course.	Students felt the course midterm was difficult, but fair. Practice problems and reviewing course notes were useful in preparing for the exam.		\N		f	f	AI	12	0	\N	\N	\N

Problem sets were very useful for the exams and for learning the material. They were sometimes long but fair and collaboration was definitely helpful. 	Labs were simple enough to understand but took lots of time. The microfluidics lab in particular was tedious though the Hodgkin-Huxley lab was more interesting. 	Grade distributions and cutoffs were not given to students. Grading for all assignments were completed quickly with feedback. Strict deadlines for the assignments should be followed closely so as not to affect grades significantly. 	The textbook was DEFINITELY necessary for the class, especially for the problem sets. The course notes were helpful for exams. 	Exams were fair and tested concepts taught. Doing practice problems before exams were helpful.

Bayesian analysis\r\nGrading cutoffs\r\nReasonable workload	Lack of overall structure \r\nLectures covering limited content\r\nDelayed posting of course notes	Students took this course because it contributed to an Artificial Intelligence  MEng concentration.	Problem Sets are a large part of the class and were useful in applying the theoretical concepts introduced in lecture. They were not always worded well and sometimes covered topics that were not taught in class. Piazza was not helpful for the problem sets due to delayed responses. Office hours were the most helpful for problem sets. 	Final project had a lot of freedom though expectations for the project were too unclear. 	Grading is fair with a distribution with a majority of A's. 	Class notes were not that helpful and there were too many "optional" readings.

Overall a great introductory class for programming, though not necessarily for theoretical computer science. 	Lab assignments\r\nProfessors Devadas and Chlipala	The lectures were not particularly helpful and not interactive. The class did not cover object oriented programming. Some labs were poorly written and required changes after they were released. 	Students took this course because it counted both as an Institute lab and an introductory Course VI department  course.	There were no problem sets. All assignments were labs. 	Labs were very important for understanding and learning programming. They were fun, well-written, and good applications for the material. Labs were of reasonable length. 	Grading was very fair and mostly automated since the class was all coding. Professors were flexible with due dates if need be and students were made aware of grade distributions. 	Course notes and python files from class were posted and useful for exam study. No textbook was used and notes were not really necessary for this class. 	Quizzes were taken on computers with instant grading from the autograder. Each of the 3 quizzes was 2 hours long and open book, closed Internet. Quizzes were fair and practice quizzes were provided.
